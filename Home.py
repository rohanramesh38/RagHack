    st.markdown("""
    MyFitnessBuddy uses a hybrid architecture combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRAG). Data is extracted using a Python script and ingested into Azure Blob Storage for structured data and Azure Cosmos DB (Gremlin API) for unstructured data. Azure AI Search indexes the structured data, while the graph database manages complex relationships in the unstructured data.
    The application utilizes Azure AI Studio and Prompt Flow to define chat logic and connect data sources. User queries are processed by the app server, retrieving relevant information from Azure AI Search and Cosmos DB, which is then sent to Azure OpenAI Services (ChatGPT) to generate personalized responses.
    This hybrid approach ensures accurate, context-aware, and personalized fitness guidance for users.
