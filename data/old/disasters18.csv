Sri Lanka: Floods and Landslides - May 2018,"The southwest monsoon weather conditions have caused rainfalls since 19 May 2018 in the southwest parts of the island. By 21 May, the precipitation triggered a flood and landslide situation in the country, which has affected thousands of lives and livelihoods, as well as caused property damage. According to the situation update by the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) of Sri Lanka confirmed that a total of 153,7122 people in 19 districts have been affected and 20 people have died due heavy rains, strong winds, lightning and landslides. Currently, 19,519 families have been evacuated into 339 welfare centres. Puttalam, Gampaha, Ratnapura, Colombo, Kurunegala, Kalutara and Kegalle are amongst the worst affected districts. The water levels of two main rivers, Kalu Ganga and Attanagalu-oya, are still at flood levels, but slowly receding. Some water reservoir gates are opened and release water to reduce the flood threat to other areas. Landslide warnings are still active in some districts due to the risk of landslides and power cuts and failures.The DMC has reported the need for drinking water, wells and area cleaning, since water sources have been contaminated. The DMC is coordinating the national response efforts. The National Disaster Relief Service centre has released 44.15 million Sri Lankan rupees (approx. CHF 276,000 Swiss francs) for the response.According to the previous experiences and scientific figures on climate condition in South Asia country including Sri Lanka, this is just the beginning of the annual monsoon season, and it is expected that the weather condition might be getting worst and extreme in the coming months. (IFRC, 30 May 2018)As of 1 June 2018, water levels in all major rivers had decreased and flood victims in over 200 welfare centres had returned to their homes. The flood affected 174,310 persons from 45,680 families. Twenty six persons were reported dead.

Bangladesh: Floods and Landslides - Apr 2018,"Pre-monsoon rains started on 18 April 2018 near Cox’s Bazar on Bangladesh’s southern coast. A risk analysis released in the beginning of this year estimated that at least 86,000 people were living in areas at particularly high risk of floods while more than 23,000 were on steep, unstable hillsides that could crumble with continuous heavy rainfall. The camp population has risen by some 200,000 people since. (Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, 22 Apr 2018)Over 40,000 Rohingya families in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar refugee camps have now been trained in shelter upgrade techniques ahead of the fast approaching monsoon and cyclone season...In total 100,000 families will be reached through the trainings, while IOM is overseeing the roll out of a similar number of upgrade kits containing ropes, bamboo, tarpaulin and tools. (IOM, 24 Apr 2018)In case of flooding, the number of people suffering acute watery diarrhea is likely to increase. UNICEF and partners are readying to support an estimated 10,000 people, more than half of which (55 per cent) are children, with treatment for Acute Watery Diarrhea over the next three months. UNICEF is constructing 5 additional Diarrhea treatment centers. One has already opened, two other will open later this week and the two last ones end of May...At least 3 out of 24 health facilities supported by UNICEF in the camps and makeshift settlements are at risk of flooding. This could affect between 25,000 and 30,000 people, more than half of which are children.

There is still a need for new de-sludging and solid waste management sites, and there remains a high risk of disease outbreaks including water borne diseases (Acute Watery Diarrhoea, Hep A, Hep E) and vector borne diseases (Dengue, Malaria), due to the poor sanitary conditions in the camps. (OCHA, 21 May 2018)Between 22-30 May 2018, 503 refugees living in camps in Cox’s Bazar and at risk of landslides or floods, were relocated to safer areas.
