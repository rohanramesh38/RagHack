Even though the flood levels reduced in the Kilinochchi District, the people have returned to the welfare centres because of heavy rains. At present, nearly 18,000 families have been affected and all the essential requirements, including cooked food, dry rations and health facilities are being provided for them. (Gov't of Sri Lanka, 26 Dec 2018)9,455 people have been displaced by flooding in Mullaithvu, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Vavuniya and Jaffna districts in north-east Sri Lanka and are now staying in 30 safety centres. Mullaithivu and Killinochchi, the two most affected districts, received more than 250 mm of rainfall over a 24 hour period on 22-23 December, the highest recorded rainfall in one day since 1983. The flooding has subsided as the weather improved over the last few days, with more than 2,000 people who had initially been displaced returning to their homes.

Iraq: Floods - Nov 2018,"Torrential rainfall on 22-23 November caused severe flooding across Iraq, leading to the displacement of thousands of people and multiple deaths and injuries. Ninewa and Salah al-Din are the most heavily affected governorates, with bridges, roads and villages being inundated; damage was also recorded in the southern part of the country. An estimated 10,000 people in Salah al-Din and 15,000 people in Ninewa need assistance, including thousands of families living in IDP camps. (OCHA, 25 Nov 2018)Assessments by humanitarian actors in Ninewa have identified immediate needs as tent replacement, provision of WASH services, and drainage/clearing operations in the Qayyarah Airstrip camp, Jeddah camps 1 through 6, Salamiyah camps 1 & 2, Hamam Al Alil camp 2 and Nimrud Camp. Food rations and NFI kits are also required as people remain displaced from home. In Salah al-Din, Rapid Needs Assessments have identified immediate needs of food, mattresses, blankets, heaters, medical assistance and cash. (OCHA, 27 Nov 2018.)Central and northwestern Iraq has experienced several episodes of torrential rainfall and severe flooding over a three-week period, most notably on 22/23 November, 30-November/1-December, and 6/7 December. These episodes were interspersed by rainy periods of lesser intensity, which nonetheless adversely affected clean-up efforts. Iraq often experiences heavy rains during winter, but storms this year have been more acute than usual. Ninewa bore the brunt of the severe weather, although other governorates were also affected.
The storms washed away buildings, roads, and bridges, and flooded IDP camps and urban areas. A temporary state of emergency was declared in Mosul on 2-December after several neighborhoods were inundated and multiple buildings collapsed. Debris clearance and rehabilitation efforts are underway, but concerns about unexploded ordinance (UXO) must be factored into response efforts.
After the initial floods on 22/23 November, camp management in several IDP camps in Ninewa instituted contingency planning which diminished the impact of subsequent storms; however, it is imperative to ensure that all 125 of Iraq’s IDP camps are restored to minimally acceptable standards, including improved flood mitigation measures.
