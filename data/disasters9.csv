Early seasonal rains have caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding vast areas and settlements across the top of the country, with more heavy rains and flooding expected in the coming months. Many of the flood-affected people moved to higher grounds within their county, and plan to return home once the flood waters recede. Some 100,000 people, mostly fromTwic East, who were displaced by the 2020 floods, still have not returned home and are sheltering in the Bor and Mangalla IDP camps, and in Mingkaman, according to humanitarian partners. A coordinated humanitarian response scale-up in the most affected states of Jonglei, Unity, Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Warrap was initiated to respond to the increased needs of people affected and displaced by the flood waters. (OCHA, 31 Aug 2021)An estimated 426,000 people were affected and displaced by floods in South Sudan since May 2021. People in Jonglei and Unity states, followed by Northern Bahr el Ghazal and Upper Nile states have been the worst affected to date.

Jonglei is the hardest hit with 305,000 people affected, followed by Unity (220,000 affected) and Upper Nile (141,000 affected). (OCHA, 14 Dec 2021)The country has faced floods for three consecutive years and the current flooding has worsened the already dire situation, and people have no food and no land to cultivate. Fields are submerged by floodwater and higher grounds are overcrowded with makeshift structures. People have been forced to leave their flooded houses to higher grounds, makeshift shelters and host families. The flooding is creating a perfect breeding ground for mosquitos, while most people don’t even have mosquito nets, leaving them dangerously exposed to diseases. The cumulative impact of the loss of harvests, cattle deaths and floods have led to the collapse of traditional livelihoods. The situation has limited food stocks in the few available functional markets and the supply of these stocks has been cut off. This has forced the food prices to go up. People have waited for flood water to recede and have watched the flood increase day by day since June 2021. (IFRC, 25 Jan 2022)Most communities affected depend on farming for survival and the flooding has made it hard to practice subsistence farming worsening food insecurity and the start of long rains in April 2022 worsening the dire situation. The impacts are especially harsh in Jonglei, Unity, and Upper Nile state, where thousands of people have been displaced or marooned in dike-ringed compounds, holding back floodwaters with mud, sticks, and plastic sheeting. In a prediction to Uganda, ICPAK has predicted heavy rainfall (greater than 100mm) over South Sudan for the period 24 – 31st May 2022 as the UN projects the impacts from floods will be even dire in South Sudan by the time the rainy season ends.

Humanitarian efforts are underway to aid displaced communities. (ECHO, 19 Sep 2022)Since late August, heavy rains and flooding impact people across the country and in the southern part of the Abyei Administrative Area, with over 900,000 people reportedly affected. Most affected states are Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap, Unity and Western Equatoria but also Jonglei and Upper Nile currently affected by conflicts and a difficult access. The floods will further drive food insecurity as 16.5kha cropland is potentially affected. Homes, schools and health facilities have been destroyed. Roads and bridges washed away hampering humanitarians to reach affected people. Boreholes and latrines submerged thereby contaminating water sources and risking outbreaks of waterborne diseases. Priority needs include food assistance, shelter, health, nutrition and WASH supplies. Contingency stocks in WASH and Shelter-Non Food Items pipelines have been considerably depleted. Flood response preparedness plans were implemented and response is ongoing, including through the EU-funded Emergency/Rapid Response Mechanisms. However, insecurity, violence against aid workers and access constraints continue to hamper the overall floods response.

According to the Meteorological Department, on 7 July, the windspeed was at 85 km per hour and was the first of its kind to be recorded in the last five years. The unfolding disaster has already caused considerable damage on the lives and livelihoods of the people. Many affected people have “no place to live and nothing to eat” said the Executive Director of National Disaster Management Agency (NMDA) at a press briefing at their head office in Kanifing on 8 July 2021 at 3:00pm, attended by the Gambia Red Cross Society (GRCS) Secretary General and essential staff.The GRCS, the NDMA and other partners immediately launched a joint rapid assessment which is still ongoing.
