The activation of the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) was authorized. Total losses and the total number of people affected by the flooding are yet to be determined. However, based on the 2012 Preliminary Census Report, with more than 70 per cent of the country’s population living along the coastal areas, a significant number of households have been either directly or indirectly affected. (IFRC, 1 Aug 2015)Continuous assessments have reaffirmed the existing needs, which include relief items such as nets, hygiene kits and storage for drinking water. There is a need to address water and sanitation issues, particularly garbage disposal and consumption of potable water and livelihood assistance, as some of the communities depend entirely on livestock and farming and have had their main source of food and
income severely affected, so their capacity to meet basic needs has been significantly reduced. (IFRC, 5 Oct 2015)",https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2015-000093-guy
Myanmar: Floods and Landslides ,Jul,2015.0,Past Disaster,Flood1 more,Myanmar,"Heavy rains caused floods and landslides in several parts of Myanmar since June 2015. On 30 July, Cyclone Komen made landfall in Bangladesh, bringing strong winds and additional heavy rains to the country, which resulted in widespread flooding across 12 of the country’s 14 states and regions (Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, Rakhine, Sagaing, Shan, Yangon). On 31 July, the President declared Chin and Rakhine states, and Magway and Sagaing regions as natural disaster zones.According to the National Natural Disaster Management Committee (NNDMC), 125 people were killed and some 1.7 million people were temporarily displaced by floods and landslides. Almost all of the displaced people had returned to their villages of origin by the end of September, leaving only about 10,000 people in evacuation centres (mainly in Sagaing Region and Chin State) awaiting relocation. The Government has said it expects most of these remaining displaced people to return to their villages of origin or to be relocated by the end of October, although a portion of these people may be in temporary accommodation for longer, particularly in the case of people who are going to be permanently relocated to new sites.The NNDMC identified Hakha in Chin State, Kale in Sagaing Region, Pwintbyu in Magway Region, and Minbya and Mrauk-U in Rakhine as the five most affected townships where a total of 229,600 people were affected by the floods. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, over 1.1 million acres of farmlands have been inundated, with more than 872,000 acres destroyed, as of 4 October. So far, 495,000 acres have since been re-cultivated. Damage to crops and arable land will disrupt the planting season and pose a risk to long-term food security.While the water has receded in most areas, many roads and bridges were destroyed in the worst affected states and regions. The roads in Chin State were particularly badly affected and continue to pose a major logistical challenge for assessments and assistance delivery.Multi-sectoral Initial Rapid Assessments (MIRA) were conducted in 317 locations of 34 townships in Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Magway, Rakhine and Sagaing, covering close to 200,000 people. Other needs assessments were also carried out in areas not covered by the MIRA assessments in Chin and Rakhine states. According to the Rakhine State Government (RSG), Buthidaung, Kyauktaw, Minbya, Maungdaw and Mrauk-U townships were the most severely affected areas in Rakhine State. In many parts of Rahine State, floods and salt water severely damaged the paddy fields. A major concern remains water contamination, as most villages use water ponds for drinking water and many ponds were flooded and contaminated.(OCHA, 4 Nov 2015)Six months on from the devastating floods that struck Myanmar, around 400,000 people have received emergency assistance and support in their recovery from the Myanmar Red Cross Society and its partners in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. At their peak the floods affected over 9 million people across 12 of Myanmar’s 14 states and regions. The floods temporarily displaced over 1.7 million people and destroyed 15,000 homes as well as more than 840,000 acres of agricultural crops.Between July 2015 and January 2016, over 1,400 Red Cross volunteers and staff from the Myanmar Red Cross Society and Red Cross partners assisted flood affected people across the country. The first phase included evacuations, providing emergency relief such as purified water, food, household items, and shelter materials.

Difficulty in road access from the affected flash flood sites hampered the search and rescue of the casualties believed to have drowned and been swept away by the strong current. The flash floods have affected approximately 879 families (4,395 people) in the affected area of Yan district and 86 families (430 people) in Kubang Pasu district. The data collected is based on the district office in Yan and Kuala Muda as of 22 August 2021.The Government opened two evacuation centres and hosted 43 people for short-term assistance. Currently, the evacuation centres had been closed. Out of 4,825 people affected by the flash flood, only 43 people went to the evacuation centres. People from the affected flash flood villages were hesitant to evacuate to the centres due to the fear of COVID-19 transmission. COVID-19 cases in the Yan district are considered high at the state level. For Yan district, 395 positive COVID-19 cases have been reported, and in Kuala Muda district, figures have reached 6,285 cases. Carrying sediment and large tree trunks, the flash floods impacted nearby houses in the Kampung Pematang Keramat. Most of the houses in this village are 2 km from the primary impact area of the foothill of Gunung Jerai. The affected houses are covered in mud, some with minor damage.Villages affected by the flash flood were covered with mud and sand on the houses since 18 August 2021. Of the three affected locations, the Yan district is the most affected location.

The ensuing floods destroyed local village livestock and vegetable farms. Local authorities have confirmed six deaths.In Kuala Muda district, most areas were covered with muddy water, tree trunks, and large rocks from the side of the river. Despite mud covering houses, flood victims did not report heavy damage. People did, however, report damage to several home appliances and furniture.

Fields are submerged by floodwater and higher grounds are overcrowded with makeshift structures. People have been forced to leave their flooded houses to higher grounds, makeshift shelters and host families. The flooding is creating a perfect breeding ground for mosquitos, while most people don’t even have mosquito nets, leaving them dangerously exposed to diseases. The cumulative impact of the loss of harvests, cattle deaths and floods have led to the collapse of traditional livelihoods. The situation has limited food stocks in the few available functional markets and the supply of these stocks has been cut off. This has forced the food prices to go up. People have waited for flood water to recede and have watched the flood increase day by day since June 2021.

Nepal: Floods and Landslides ,Jun,2024.0,Past Disaster,Flood,Nepal,"Flood is the most severe of the hazards observed in Nepal in terms of physical and socioeconomic losses and destruction. Koshi, Karnali, and Narayani are the major river systems in Nepal, and floods from these large perennial river systems generally impact several districts in the Southern Terai plains. Moreover, rivers such as West Rapti, and Babai Rivers, which originate in the Mahabharat range, do more damage in the Terai floodplains because they frequently generate flash floods during the monsoon. Moreover, the Terai's vulnerable topography, combined with its dependency on agriculture, exacerbates the severity of flood hazards compared to other regions. (IFRC, 12 Jun 2024)The targeted flood-prone areas are the Terai districts along the flood plains of Karnali, Babai and West Rapti rivers, namely Banke, Bardiya and Kailali, frequently affected due to flooding in the monsoon period.

(OCHA, 12 Jun 2023)The approval of the distribution and transportation plans for the Cyclone Mocha response inRakhine and Chinremains pending. Significant conditions, imposed by the State Administration Council, remain in place for the replenishment of relief supplies from outside the country and some have not yet been approved. [...] Meanwhile, efforts are underway to engage with the de facto authorities at the Nay Pyi Taw and regional level to try and expand access to people in need. This included high-level engagement with Union ministers by the RC/HC ai and UN agencies in Sittwe. Despite the humanitarian access restrictions, aid organizations have been delivering vital assistance to cyclone-affected communities where they have authorizations and supplies. More than 144,000 affected people have received shelter and other essential relief items in Rakhine and other areas since the cyclone. However, only a fraction of damaged and destroyed shelters have reportedly been repaired, leaving thousands of people without a proper roof over their heads during the monsoon season and exposing them to overcrowding and lack of privacy in the few shelters that remain functional. (OCHA, 19 Jun 2023)As schools reopen amid the devastation caused by Cyclone Mocha, more than 300,000 learners require educational support, and an estimated 1,246 schools are heavily damaged across Rakhine and the Northwest. [...] Travel authorization issues pose challenges to the operations of Cluster partners, severely delaying the delivery of response activities. In Kyauktaw township, the need for partners to actively provide education services during emergencies hampers education delivery in critical situations. Cyclone-affected areas across the country are struggling with debris that has yet to be cleared, slowing down the repair and reopening of schools. The persistent aerial attacks on schools have exacerbated the humanitarian situation for learners. These attacks not only endanger the lives and well-being of students but also threatens the stability of the education system. (UNICEF, 3 Jul 2023)InRakhine, three months following Cyclone Mocha, decision making for the cyclone response continued to be centralized in Nay Pyi Taw which has significantly delayed disaster response.

Sindh and Balochistan are the two most affected provinces in terms of human and infrastructural impact. Over 504,000 livestock have been killed, nearly all of them in Balochistan Province, while damages to nearly 3,000 km of roads and 129 bridges have impeded access across flood-affected areas. At the request of the Balochistan Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), a multisectoral rapid needs assessment was undertaken in 10 districts of Balochistan to identify priority needs and gaps across sectors. Humanitarian partners are supporting the Government-led response in affected areas, redirecting existing resources to meet the most urgent needs while working to further scale up the response. (OCHA, 23 Aug 2022)The humanitarian situation in Pakistan has deteriorated further over the past two weeks as heavy rains continue to cause flooding, and landslides resulting in displacement and damage across the country. Sixty-six districts have been officially declared to be ‘calamity hit’ by the Government of Pakistan – 31 in Balochistan, 23 in Sindh, nine in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and three in Punjab. 116 districts have been affected, including 66 districts officially declared ‘calamity hit’. At least 937 people were killed and 1,343 people injured since 14 June. Over 218,000 houses have been destroyed and a further 452,000 damaged since 14 June, according to the NDMA. (OCHA, 26 Aug 2022)The number of damaged and destroyed houses in Pakistan has tripled since the last Weekly Regional Humanitarian Snapshot, with around 950,000 houses impacted as of 27 August. At the province level, since last week the number of damaged/destroyed houses more than tripled in Sindh (to over 807,000 houses) and more than doubled in Balochistan (to nearly 61,500 houses) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (to over 33,200 houses). In Punjab, more than 46,300 houses have been damaged/destroyed, some 18,500 more than a week earlier. A Floods Response Plan has been developed to complement the wider government response and aims to aid some 5.2 million flood-affected people for the next six months. (OCHA, 31 Aug 2022)Eight more districts have been declared ‘calamity hit’ by the Government of Pakistan, bringing the total to 80 districts. Over 1.1 million houses have now been damaged or destroyed. Some 1,600 km of roads damaged or destroyed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa within the last week.

Preliminary estimates based on currently available data indicate that some 7.6 million people may be displaced due to the heavy rains and floods, including some 575,000 people living in relief camps. (OCHA, 16 Sep 2022)The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has recorded over 1,600 deaths and more than 12,850 injuries since mid-June, including 579 children killed and over 4,000 children injured. [...] Pregnant and lactating women (PLW) and children under age five represent the most vulnerable at-risk groups, with estimates indicating that at least 83,000 flood-affected women are pregnant and due to give birth in the coming months. Assessments indicate that some 1,460 health facilities and their contents are damaged. (OCHA, 23 Sep 2022)Prevalence of water-borne and vector-borne diseases is a growing concern especially in Sindh and Balochistan, where many districts remain inundated. 8.62 million people in 28 assessed districts estimated to be in crisis and emergency phases of food security between September and November 2022, according to preliminary findings from Balochistan, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – including some 5.74 million people in flood-affected districts covered by the assessment. (OCHA, 30 Sep 2022)Around 33 million people have been affected by the heavy rains and floods, including at least 7.9 million people who have been displaced, of whom some 598,000 are living in relief camps. Nearly 800,000 refugees are estimated to be hosted in more than 40 calamity-notified districts. More than 2 million houses have been affected, comprising over 767,000 houses destroyed and nearly 1.3 million houses damaged. More than 1.1 million livestock have reportedly been killed. FAO assesses that some 9.4 million acres of crop area in Pakistan was potentially inundated in August. (OCHA, 4 Sep 2022)Over 2 million houses have been impacted by the devastating floods in Pakistan as of 11 October, with over 1.3 million houses partially destroyed and 800,000 fully destroyed. Some 13,115 km of roads were damaged, and 436 bridges were partially damaged or destroyed. In total, 1,700 people have died, and 12,867 have suffered injuries. The currently available data indicate that around 7.9 million people may be temporarily displaced. About 20.6 million people and 650,000 flood-affected refugees and host communities require humanitarian assistance. The Government of Pakistan is leading the response with the support of UN agencies and humanitarian partners to ensure a coordinated response in food, medicines, health, water, sanitation, and essential supplies and non-food items. (OCHA, 10 Oct 2022)In Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa areas, people are returning to their places of origin or at least close to it to assess their livelihoods' condition. During the last weeks' receding waters were observed, particularly in affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan. In Sindh, water is receding in the districts of Kashmore, Kandhkot, Larkana, Ghotki, Sukkur, Tando Allahyar, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Umerkot and Sanghar. [...] In the flood-affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan, outbreaks of water-borne and vector-borne diseases continue to increase, particularly due to the destruction of health facilities and standing water. The Government-led multi-sector rapid needs assessments (RNA) conducted in the worst-affected districts of Sindh indicated that thirty-seven per cent of key informants reported that the nearest health facility is not functional, and the ones who reported a health facility nearby stated the limited capacity of the facility. As of 5 October, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), close to 2,000 health facilities have been either damaged or destroyed. [...] The health situation is also exacerbated by the lack of adequate sanitation facilities. Large parts of Sindh remain flooded, with access continuing to be a challenge in inundated areas. An estimated 5.5 million people no longer have access to safe drinking water due to damages to water infrastructure and sanitation facilities. [...] The current floods have aggravated food insecurity and malnutrition in flood-affected areas. An estimated 14.6 million people require emergency food assistance from December through March 2023, representing an increase of more than 100 per cent of the pre-flood estimate. This includes 4 million people in Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). (OCHA, 14 Oct 2022)The monsoon rains continue to affect Pakistan by causing floods, landslides, flash floods, and severe weather-related incidents, which have resulted in a humanitarian emergency. Since mid-June, at least 1,730 people have died, of which 792 people died in Sindh Province (south-eastern Pakistan), 336 in Balochistan (south-western Pakistan), and 308 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (north-western Pakistan), according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Nearly 12,865 individuals have been injured across all Provinces of Pakistan and more than 33 Million people have been affected, of which 14.5 Million in Sindh, and 9.2 million in Balochistan. Widespread damage has been reported to over 2.2 million houses, more than 1.1 million livestock has been lost and more than 13,000 km of roads and 440 bridges have been affected. (ECHO, 25 Oct 2022)Malaria cases are increasing due to the stagnant water, while the incidence of diarrhea is at least five times higher than usual, especially in Sindh and Balochistan, where more than 1 in 9 children under five admitted to health facilities suffered from severe acute malnutrition. More than 3.5 million children's education was interrupted due to the impact of floods. Some sectors noted inadequate funding and delays in supplies as a major gap in responding to the needs of hard-to-reach areas. Roughly only 15-20 per cent of the affected population has received relief assistance from humanitarians. (OCHA, 29 Oct 2022)Public health concerns are high in flood-affected areas of Pakistan, particularly with access to primary healthcare limited by monsoon-induced damage to health facilities. As of 25 October, 59 health facilities are destroyed and 461 are partially damaged in Sindh, where nearly 350,000 people were suspected of having malaria, more than 700,000 people had diarrhea, and over 770,000 people reported a skin-related disease between July and early October. Stagnant water has contributed to malaria outbreaks in 32 districts in Sindh and Balochistan. The practice of open defecation has increased from one-fifth before the floods to over one-third of the affected population, with 6 million people no longer having home sanitation facilities. (OCHA, 1 Nov 2022)As of 8 November, according to World Health Organization (WHO), around 8 million flood-affected people need health assistance. Vector-borne and water-borne diseases remain a major concern in flood-affected areas. Around 1,000 confirmed cholera cases and 64,767 dengue fever cases, with 147 deaths, have been reported. More than 5.1 million women are of reproductive age, including an estimated 410,846 pregnant women. Approximately 136,950 births are expected in the next three months. (OCHA, 11 Nov 2022)According to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), more than 33 million persons have been affected by the humanitarian emergency caused by the floods, about 1,739 people have died and almost 8 million people have been displaced. Widespread damage has been reported to critical infrastructure, houses and livestock. The findings from a recent ECHO field staff’s visit to flood-affected areas in Sindh and Balochistan show that the situation remains dire with great extensions of land still covered by water. At least 1.85 million people remain still displaced, living in roadside spontaneous camps in poor conditions. A serious concern remains that many of the people returning are moved to places with no infrastructure, no shelter and residing on elevated areas with flood waters around. (OCHA, 28 Nov 2022)Floodwaters continue to recede in many flood-affected areas across Pakistan. However, standing flood waters continue to be reported in Dadu, Kambar, Shahdad Kot, Khairpur, Mirpur Khas, Jamshoro, Sanghar, Umer Kot, Badin, Shaheed Benazir Abad and Naushahro Feroze districts in Sindh and Sohbatpur and Jaffarabad districts in Balochistan. United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) imagery indicates an estimated 8 million people still potentially exposed to floodwaters or living close to flooded areas. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Sindh, over 240,000 people remain displaced in the province as of 3 December, down from 6.5 million in early September. Nearly 90% of flood-displaced people are reportedly with host communities, while the remaining are in tent cities and relief camps. While receding flood waters have allowed millions of people to go home, there are reports of significant service gaps in areas of return, in addition to extensive impacts to homes, agriculture, and livelihoods. [...] A recent need and gaps analysis by partners in the food security sector indicates a persistent and increasing need for emergency food assistance moving into the first quarter of 2023. A failure to address this need would worsen the already frail food security situation and drive more people into crisis and emergency levels. The food security situation of an estimated additional 1.1 million people is deteriorating and are forecast to fall into IPC 4 (emergency food security phase)
between January-March 2023. Evidence from available data indicates that relief response to date has fallen well short of the need, with over 5.1 million people now experiencing IPC 4 conditions in flood-affected areas. (OCHA, 5 Dec 2022)During the monsoon season, rainfall was equivalent to nearly 2.9 times the national 30-year average, causing widespread flooding and landslides with severe repercussions for human lives, property, and infrastructure. An estimated 20.6 million people, including 9.6 million children, need humanitarian assistance. To date, 94 districts have been declared ‘calamity hit’ by the Government of Pakistan. Many of the hardest-hit districts are amongst the most vulnerable districts in Pakistan, where children already suffer from high malnutrition, poor access to water and sanitation, low school enrolment, and other deprivations. In mountainous and high altitude areas of Pakistan, many also affected by the floods, have received snowfall and temperatures have fallen below 0 Celsius, particularly in the northern and northwestern parts of Pakistan including Khyber Pakhtunkwa (KP), Gilgit Baltistan (GB), Pakistan Administered Kashmir (PAK) and northern Balochistan. (UNICEF, 23 Dec 2022)In some locations of Sindh province and in parts of Balochistan, water has yet to recede and may remain for several months, prolonging the dire humanitarian situation for people in these areas. Flood water remains stagnant in Dadu, Jacobabad, Kambar, Shahdad Kot, Khairpur, Mirpur Khas, Jamshoro, Sanghar, Umer Kot, Badin, Shaheed Benazir Abad and Naushahro Feroze districts in Sindh and Sohbatpur, Jhal Magsi and Jaffarabad districts in Balochistan. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Sindh, over 89,000 people remain displaced in the province as of 2 January 2023, down from 6.5 million in early September. The IDPs living in ten districts including Dadu, ShikarPur, Matiari, Mirpur Khas, Jaccobabad, Jamshoro, Tando Allahyar, Thatta, Khairpur and Karachi with the highest number of IDPs in Dadu (41,742) and the lowest in Karachi (356 IDPs). (OCHA, 6 Jan 2023)Food security, livelihood-related assistance and public health are the biggest concerns: based on the latest analysis by UNOSAT, an estimated 4.5 million people remain exposed to or living close to flooded areas. More than 2.5 million people do not have access to safe or potable water. An estimated 1.1 million people are at risk of sliding from acute food and livelihood crisis (IPC3) situations to humanitarian emergency (IPC4) food security situations due to insufficient support. Malaria outbreaks have been reported in at least 12 districts of Sindh and Balochistan. More than 7 million children and women need immediate access to nutrition services. An estimated 3.5 million children, especially girls, are at high risk of permanent school dropout. The Pakistan Floods Response Plan is only 36 per cent funded more than halfway through its 9-month duration. (OCHA, 6 Feb 2023)Camps housing internally displaced persons in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and Punjab provinces have closed, while 29,692 people remain
displaced in Sindh province, with 5,132 people living in temporary tent cities or villages established by the District Disaster Management Authority. High food prices and a heavy reliance on imports continue to threaten Pakistan's food and nutrition security. Meanwhile, the 2022-2023 Rabi season, combined with the unstable availability of wheat flour, has resulted in significant price fluctuations and uncertainty affecting other essential goods’ prices. According to WFP monitoring data, the floods led to a 53 percent increase in new malnutrition cases from July 2022 to January 2023 amongst children enrolled in the 50 pilot facilitation centres of theBenazir Nashonuma Programme, the national social protection scheme aimed at improved health and nutrition. Additional funding is urgently required to treat Moderate and Acute Malnutrition (MAM) to prevent the progression to Severe Acute Malnutrition. (WFP, 28 Feb 2023)Six months after the Government of Pakistan declared a national emergency, approximately 1.8 million people are still living near contaminated and stagnant floodwater pools. Nutrition, food security and public health are the major concerns as many of these people are in temporary shelters, lack basic food items (at risk of sliding into emergency level of hungers) and increased cases of malnutrition. Besides other humanitarian needs in Sindh province, PDMA Sind has declared an urgent need for dewatering activities in the districts of Nausharo Feroze, Khairpur, Sukkur, Jhatta, and Ghotki. To achieve this, five excavators, dewatering pumps, and fuel are required to complete the dewatering process and provide the people in these areas with appropriate livelihood standards. (OCHA, 9 Mar 2023)There is a looming nutrition crisis: the number of children suffering from wasting in Pakistan’s flood-affected areas had greatly increased compared to the pre-flood situation, which was already reaching emergency levels. A rapid survey by UNICEF in 15 flood-affected districts reveals that one-third of children aged 6-23 months suffer from moderate acute malnutrition, and 14% suffer from severe acute malnutrition, a life-threatening form of malnutrition. The rate of severe acute malnutrition in Pakistan is twice that of the South Asian region and four times higher than the global average. The United Nations in Pakistan dedicates US$5.5 million out of the US$6.5 million allocation received from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) towards emergency nutrition and food security interventions in flood impacted areas of Sindh and Balochistan. According to the latest WFP Market Monitor Report, Pakistan's Headline inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the highest it has been in the past 49 years, having increased by 31.55 per cent in February 2023 compared to February 2022. Since April 2023, heavy rainfall and flashfloods have tragically caused the death of 19 people, injured more than 10, and destroyed properties, bridges, highways, crops, and livestock. (OCHA, 8 May 2023)Despite the passage of nearly a year since the floods, Pakistan is currently facing an imminent nutrition crisis, which has been aggravated by pre-existing high rates of malnutrition in flood-affected regions. Of particular concern is the increasing malnutrition among young children, as undernutrition accounts for nearly half of all deaths in children under five. Shockingly, one in five children under five in Pakistan suffer from wasting, with severe and moderate acute malnutrition rates at 8 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively. The 84 districts affected by the 2022 monsoon flooding display distressing nutrition indicators. These districts have an average severe acute malnutrition rate of 12 percent, impacting over 3.5 million children. Among them, more than 1.45 million children require treatment with Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) due to severe wasting. [...] As of June 5, 2023, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) indicates that approximately 10.5 million people (29 percent of those analyzed) from 43 districts in vulnerable provinces of Pakistan are facing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). Within this population, around 2.1 million individuals (6 percent) are in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), while 8.4 million people (23 percent) are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). These areas, including Balochistan (18 districts), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (9 districts), and Sindh (16 districts), were severely affected by the monsoon rains and flooding in late 2022, which greatly impacted food production, consumption, livelihoods, and employment opportunities. (OCHA, 13 Jun 2023)According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the first spell of monsoon rains in Pakistan during the period of 25 June to 10 July has resulted in 86 deaths, 151 injuries, damage to 97 houses, and the loss of 46 livestock. In Punjab province, Lahore City witnessed an exceptional volume of rainfall, setting a record for the highest levels observed in the past three decades. With over 200 mm of rainfall, the city faced significant urban flooding. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued warnings of more rains, wind-thunderstorm, land sliding in hilly areas and high-level flooding in rivers such as Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab, and Jhelum. It is important to note that the monsoon rains are exacerbating the already dire conditions faced by the communities that have been affected by the 2022 floods in Pakistan. Waterborne and vector-borne diseases remain a significant concern in flood-affected districts. 82 cases of Cholera were reported from 12 flood-affected districts.

More than 2,400 hectares of fields were destroyed, 3,019 livestock were lost, 190 water points and 535 latrines were submerged. Communities were forced to move to safer areas, often in very precarious conditions with difficult access to drinking water, lack of latrines, food, shelters, etc. Access to hard-to-reach areas has been severely hampered by the floods, impacting the timely delivery of nutrition, food, health and protection services. Continued rainfall and rising water levels could cause the remaining dikes along the Logone river and Lake Maga to break, resulting in flooding in several localities. Despite the spontaneous response of local authorities and of the Cameroonian Red Cross, needs remain high, and the funds limited. Under the coordination of OCHA, humanitarian actors in the region are further helping to assess the situation and organizing the support to the ongoing response made by local authorities. (OCHA, 11 Oct 2022)More than 150,000 people have been affected by flooding resulting from heavy rainfall and river overflow in the Far North region since August. Floods have destroyed over 18,000 homes and at least 27,400 hectares of fields. Water points and latrines were damaged and more than 5,800 cattle lost. School activities were disrupted as more than 126 schools were flooded, affecting more than 38,000 students. Mayo-Danay, Logone et Chari, and Mayo-Tsanaga are the most affected departments. Access to the affected areas is reduced due to flooded roads while the presence of hippos in the waterways discourages travel by boat. Thousands of people have been displaced to areas not affected by the floods with limited access to drinking water, latrines, and food. The majority of displaced people are with host families or in makeshift shelters in the open air. Most urgent needs include shelter, WASH, food, NFIs and healthcare.

In Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected an estimated 25,000 people in 15 villages in Jowhar, displacing people in eight villages and inundating farms. FAO/SWALIM has warned of the imminent danger of potentially unprecedented flooding expected along the Shabelle river in the coming days and the concern for safety and wellbeing of the people in Belet Weyne and along the river. Reports from Jubaland indicate that the Juba river broke its bank in Doolow, reaching 4.70 metres, which is 0.20 metres above the moderate flooding level, flooding three villages.(OCHA, 9 May 2021)The recent torrential rains across Somalia affected an estimated 166,000 people. While the rains have reduced in some areas, humanitarian partners are alarmed that Somalia has been hit by a double climate disaster, with drought declared on 25 April and heavy rains last week causing riverine and flash flooding. The seven-day forecast ending 20 May indicates a dry spell is likely across Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands, which may lead to a reduction of the risk of flooding along the Shabelle and Juba rivers. Humanitarian partners are particularly concerned about areas where the risk of flooding remans, particularly in Belet Weyne in Hiiran region and Doolow in Jubaland where there remains a high-risk level of flooding as the water from Ethiopia highlands stream in. The flood wave from Belet Weyne will be transmitted to the middle and lower reaches towards the end of the week and therefore there is a moderate risk of flooding in these areas during this week. The situation could be further exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks, which is already causing floods in Jowhar.(OCHA, 17 May 2021)The ongoing Gu’ rains have significantly reduced with many parts of Somalia receiving below average cumulative amounts over the last week. The latest forecast indicates that the continuation of these rains from late May through June is uncertain.

As water levels rise in rivers, there are reports of riverine flooding in Jubaland. FAO’s Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM) reported heavy rains in Somaliland where on 26 April, Lughaye and surrounding areas received unusually heavy rains of 102mm. On 23 April, heavy rains were also received within the Juba river basin. SWALIM forecasts increased rainfall activity in most areas in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands in the coming week, which is likely to keep the water levels high in the Shabelle and Juba rivers. The flooding has started barely four months after heavy Deyr (October-December) rains inundated parts of Somalia, affecting over half a million people; and as the country works to contain the COVID-19 virus, which is exponentially rising and has already infected several hundreds of people. The country is also working to contain a desert locust infestation.OCHA, 24 Apr 2020)Since 20 April, heavy rain has been affecting most of Somalia States and territories (particularly South West, Jubaland, Banadir, Puntland, and Somaliland) as well as the neighbouring central and south Ethiopia since 24 April, causing rivers to overflow and triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The worst affected area is the Juba river basin and the Shabelle river basin.

At least 27 districts are inundated; the worst being Belet Weyne in Hiran region where riverine flooding has displaced more than 115,000 people, according to the district flood taskforce. This includes about 91,000 people who have been displaced from the four sections of the town and 23,220 people from 23 riverine villages. The flooding resulted from a sharp rise in the level of the Shabelle river following heavy rains in Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands.

Heavy and above-average rainfall is anticipated to continue until mid-May, potentially increasing displacement and testing coping capacity. Capacity to provide aid may be restricted throughout the upcoming rains, particularly as elections in May may divert government attention and resources. If flood water is untreated and people cannot access safe water, cholera and malaria may further spread.

Weeks of torrential rain have hit Burundi affecting 45,000 people and sweeping away thousands of homes and businesses, leaving 18,000 people newly displaced. Three large displacement sites for victims have emerged around Burundi’s capital, Bujumbura, where thousands are living in temporary or makeshift accommodations. There are concerns the new displacement sites could increase their risk of contracting COVID-19, due to their overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. IOM under the coordination of OCHA, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and other UN agencies here are moving to reduce risk of potential exposure to COVID-19 during distributions of shelter, hygiene kits, and other types of emergency support.

During flood-related displacement, host communities tend to extend their limited resources to families in need. Most displaced families are normally hosted by relatives or in neighbouring communities while they wait for the rain to subside prior to starting repair of their shelters. This coping mechanism creates favourable conditions for higher transmission of COVID-19 and in some cases may give rise to protection concerns for displaced people and their hosts.

These episodes were interspersed by rainy periods of lesser intensity, which nonetheless adversely affected clean-up efforts. Iraq often experiences heavy rains during winter, but storms this year have been more acute than usual. Ninewa bore the brunt of the severe weather, although other governorates were also affected.
The storms washed away buildings, roads, and bridges, and flooded IDP camps and urban areas.

Debris clearance and rehabilitation efforts are underway, but concerns about unexploded ordinance (UXO) must be factored into response efforts.
After the initial floods on 22/23 November, camp management in several IDP camps in Ninewa instituted contingency planning which diminished the impact of subsequent storms; however, it is imperative to ensure that all 125 of Iraq’s IDP camps are restored to minimally acceptable standards, including improved flood mitigation measures.
