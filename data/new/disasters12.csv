Cameroon: Floods ,Aug,2020,Past Disaster,Flood,Cameroon,"Heavy rainfall in Mayo-Danay division, Far North region, at the end of July has caused widespread flooding in seven districts. According to the Cameroonian Red Cross, 5,553 people, including 1,260 children under five years old and 407 individuals with special needs have lost their shelter, personal belongings, livestock and field crops. The Cameroonian Red Cross has provided empty bags to build small dykes to prevent further damages, but the assistance capacity is insufficient because of the absence of humanitarian organizations in the division. More rain is forecasted and further floods expected across the Logone river. (OCHA, 19 Aug 2020)The Far-North region has been drenched by heavy rains since the beginning of the rainy season in July and between 11 and 12 September 2020, intense and continuous rains poured in the Mayo-Danay (19,218 people) and in the Mayo-Kani (7,184 people) divisions with a an unprecedented level of rainfall ranging between 40mm and 85mm. According to data collected by the local Red Cross committees in the concerned divisions, more than 26,402 people have been affected...The forecast and the rainy season which usually lasts until the end of October, raise fears of further loss of human life and significant deterioration of the situation. The climate forecasts of the Climatology and Data Bank Service (part of the Directorate of National Meteorology) which predicted new rainfall by the end of September proved to be correct. In recent days, the region has been hit by new rains thereby worsening the situation in the affected areas. Rainfall was between 40mm and 85mm and the forecast continues to anticipate rain in October. In addition, the maps of the geographical relief of the area which feature flood zones anticipate that the rains in the Logone-and-Chari and Diamaré divisions flow into the Mayo-Kani and Mayo-Danay valleys, which are the most at risk due to their geography. In these areas, there are also dams that are at risk of breaking under the pressure of such amount of rains. (IFRC, 8 Oct 2020)As of 23 October 2020, flooding affected around 193,000 people in five regions of Cameroon (Far-North, Littoral, South, SouthWest and West).

Sudan: Floods ,Jul,2020,Past Disaster,Flood,Sudan,"Heavy rains in Sudan have intensified over the past week, causing flooding, destruction of infrastructure, houses and livelihoods, and leading to displacement in multiple locations across the country. Khartoum, Blue Nile and River Nile are amongst the most affected states. Floods have also led to damages and affected people in other regions, including El Gezira, West Kordofan and South Darfur. In the Blue Nile State, the state with highest number of people affected so far, the Bout Earth Dam, in Tadamon locality, exceeded its full capacity and collapsed, following the strong rainfall received on 29 July. At least 12 neighbourhoods downstream in Bout Town were flooded due the incident, affecting around 3,900 people. Most of them were rendered homeless and are now sheltering with host families, as nearly 190 houses were destroyed and 590 damaged, according to Government’s Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC). More houses are expected to collapse, as the rains continue in a zone where the land is already extremely wet. (OCHA, 3 Aug 2020).Heavy rain continues to affect 14 of the 18 States, causing widespread floods and leading to an increasing number of casualties and damage. According to UN OCHA, at least 1,100 people have been displaced (600 in North Darfur, and 500 in White Nile State) and more than 50,000 people affected. In addition, media report 10 deaths, 3 injured and more than 3,000 houses destroyed or damaged. National authorities and humanitarian partners are monitoring the situation and are providing relief to those affected. For the next 24 hours, more heavy rain is expected across southern States. Sudan's Meteorological Authority has warned that more heavy rain is expected over August and September, which risks leading to further flooding and displacement. (ECHO, 7 Aug 2020)An estimated 125,000 refugees and internally displaced people have been affected in total, particularly in East Sudan, White Nile, Darfur and Khartoum, many in urgent need of shelter and other emergency assistance.

Light to locally moderate rain is forecast over southern Sudan on 22-23 September. (ECHO, 22 Sep 2020)Rains started to subside and flood waters are receding in Sudan, after months of heavy rainfall that left more than 875,000 people affected by unprecedented flooding. Torrential downpours, landslides, flash and riverine flooding have killed over 150 people and left a path of destruction in all states across the country, according to the Government's Humanitarian Aid Commission data. More than 30 per cent of the water samples analyzed across 13 states were contaminated and the extensive damage to hundreds of water sources, the collapse of several thousands of latrines increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks. Over 10 million people are now at risk of contracting water-borne diseases, and more than 4.5 million are exposed to vector-borne diseases, an increase of nearly 100 per cent if compared with April 2020.
