(ECHO, 16 Dec 2020)TC Yasa will make landfall on 17 Dec around 8pm Fiji time on Vanua Levu island (population 135,961) and pass over many other smaller islands in the Fiji island group as a Cat 5 storm. According to analysis by the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC), approximately 73,000 people are potentially exposed to widespread wind damage. Severe impact for outlying areas on Eastern coast of Vanua Levu in particular Bua Province, is expected. There is a 4pm curfew in place for the whole country and all public transport is stopped.  (OCHA, 17 Dec 2020)TC Yasa, with Cat 5 intensity, made landfall over Vanua Levu, Fiji, in the evening of 17 December. It caused heavy destruction to infrastructure, buildings and agricultural areas. The Government of Fiji speaks of hundreds of millions of dollars. It was the strongest storm in the basin since TC Winston in 2016 and the strongest in the cyclone season 2020 – 21. (OCHA, 18 Dec 2020)Preliminary information indicates that some areas were severely impacted while others were almost untouched, showing a very uneven pattern of destruction. 04 persons have been confirmed dead by the authorities: three persons died from collapsing walls, one person drowned. One person is still missing. As of today, there were 7,731 persons in 183 evacuation centres, the vast majority (6,313 persons) in the Northern Division (in 133 Evacuation Centres).

(ECHO, 21 Dec 2020)The government-led Initial Damage Assessment estimates the loss of Crops, Livestock and Infrastructure at FJD 109m (approx. USD 53m). Some areas are still not accessible, particularly remote islands. First humanitarian assistance deliveries to people in need are taking place. There are still 159 Evacuation Centres open (mostly in the Northern Division) accommodating 5,346 evacuees. (OCHA, 24 Dec 2020)As of 28 December, there were 84 Evacuation Centres (ECs) open, accommodating 3,206 evacuees. The majority of these centres were in the Northern Division (80 centres with 3,021persons), the rest (04) in the Eastern Division (with 185 persons). All ECs in the Central and Western Division are closed. Assessments and initial distribution of relief assistance are continuing throughout affected areas. (OCHA, 29 Dec 2020)Damage assessments continue throughout areas affected by Tropical Cyclone Yasa, which made landfall over Vanua Levu on 17th December 2020 and affected an estimated 93,000 people. Most evacuation sites have been closed after people were able to return home, with 36 evacuation centers remaining open to accommodate 928 people. Humanitarian response is ongoing with the distribution of food rations, non-food items, and hygiene supplies. (OCHA, 4 Jan 2021)As of 5 January, 35 Evacuation Centres (all in the Northern Division) remain active, accommodating 803 persons. Delivery of food rations and NFIs to open ECs is continuing. No schools are used anymore as evacuation centres. However, there are community members who cannot return to their villages, they will be supported with tents and other facilities to stay within the school premises temporarily. All schools should be ready for the start of the school year on 18 January. (OCHA, 6 Jan 2021)On 30 January, Tropical Cyclone Ana followed a similar path as Tropical Cyclone Yasa but made landfall westwards over the main island of Viti Levu. TC Ana entered Fiji waters as a Category 2 cyclone but brought a lot of rain causing widespread flooding across the Central, Western and Northern Divisions. Impacts of TC Ana have been felt across the whole country. Worst impacted are the communities in the provinces of Macuata and Cakaudrove that were still recovering from TC Yasa. As of 2 February, Fiji National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) reported 14,755 evacuees in 422 evacuation centres across the country. Extensive flooding caused damage to infrastructure with 131 roads and crossings temporarily closed. All major roads in Vanua Levu remained closed cutting off supply of food and relief items to affected areas. There have been two confirmed fatalities and three people reported missing. The main concerns are increased risk of leptospirosis, typhoid, dengue and diarrhoea due to poor water access and standing water. Hygiene is a concern due to the lack of access to clean water. Early recovery efforts for livelihoods, fixing shelters and access to food and water are all required, acknowledging future cyclones may occur before the cyclone season ends in May 2021.

Sri Lanka: Floods ,Dec,2020,Past Disaster,Flood,Sri Lanka,"The Northeast monsoon and activation of a depression in the south-east Bay of Bengal have been intensifying rainfall in Sri Lanka from 2 to 5 December 2020 where the northern province of Sri Lanka is worst affected. Sri Lanka’s Department of Meteorology has reported a maximum rainfall up to 279.8 millimetres in the northern province particularly in Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts. During this period two deaths have been reported in Jaffna district and the Government of Sri Lanka has declared a local level emergency in the Northern Province, hence schools and other institutions in the province were closed. The continuous rains are still inundating most of the low-lying areas in the two districts and have caused damages to residential areas. As this situation is intensifying, agricultural lands and standing crops are also inundated and damaged as well as the infrastructures. As of 10th December, It is expected that this heavy rainfall is going to continue, which will have an impact and further exacerbate the capacity of vulnerable households in the affected areas. According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) situation report, as of 8 December 2020, 111,659 people (33,316 families) have been affected across 14 districts. According to the report, 106 houses are fully damaged, and 3,783 houses are partially damaged. A total of 15 evacuation centres are activated and 232 families are located in these centres.

Hurricane Iota ,Nov,2020,Past Disaster,Flood2 more,Nicaragua6 more,"Millions suffering fromEta’s consequences are now on the brink of facing a second major storm in as many weeks, with Hurricane Iota bearing down on Central America’s Caribbean coasts on a path virtually identical to that of Eta and setting up a potentially catastrophic scenario upon its projected landfall as a Category 5 storm. Iota, the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season’s 30th named storm, is currently a Category 4 hurricane featuring maximum sustained winds of 245 km/h and is forecast to bring rainfall of up to 400mm in Honduras, northern Nicaragua, Guatemala and southern Belize. These conditions will bring significant, life-threatening flash flooding and river flooding, along with landslides in higher elevation areas, risks that are compounded by high soil saturations from Eta. (OCHA, 17 Nov 2020)Hurricane Iota made landfall over northern Nicaragua early on 17 November as a Category 4 storm, reaching sufficient intensity to qualify as the strongest Atlantic hurricane in 2020, the busiest season ever recorded and the only season ever to see two major hurricanes in November. Although Iota has since degraded to remnants of a tropical depression, persistent rains over areas reeling from Eta's impact have caused added flooding and landslides, increasing official counts of people affected and people in shelters in various countries and growing government-led response efforts to account for the newly affected.

South Sudan: Floods ,Aug,2020,Past Disaster,Flood,South Sudan,"As of late July, short periods of high-intensity rain have resulted in a seasonal overflow of the Nile River in low-lying, flood-prone areas of Bor, Duk, and Twic East in Jonglei. The floods displaced approximately 1,800 households in Bor South and submerged crops in Duk. The NOAA/NCEP Global Ensemble Forecast System shows a sustained likelihood of heavy rainfall through August 10, 2020, in eastern South Sudan. Although the scale of flooding is lower in 2020 compared to 2019 so far, a consecutive year of flood-induced crop and livestock losses in low-lying areas along the Nile River and Pibor-Akobo-Sobat basin would exacerbate existing food insecurity into the post-harvest period. (FEWSNET, 4 Aug 2020)Engineering troops serving with the UN Mission in South Sudan are engaged in an ongoing battle against flooding caused by broken dykes in Bor, in Jonglei, aggravated by heavy downpours.
