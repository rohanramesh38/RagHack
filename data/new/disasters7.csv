(OCHA, 23 Sep 2022)Prevalence of water-borne and vector-borne diseases is a growing concern especially in Sindh and Balochistan, where many districts remain inundated. 8.62 million people in 28 assessed districts estimated to be in crisis and emergency phases of food security between September and November 2022, according to preliminary findings from Balochistan, Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa – including some 5.74 million people in flood-affected districts covered by the assessment. (OCHA, 30 Sep 2022)Around 33 million people have been affected by the heavy rains and floods, including at least 7.9 million people who have been displaced, of whom some 598,000 are living in relief camps. Nearly 800,000 refugees are estimated to be hosted in more than 40 calamity-notified districts. More than 2 million houses have been affected, comprising over 767,000 houses destroyed and nearly 1.3 million houses damaged. More than 1.1 million livestock have reportedly been killed. FAO assesses that some 9.4 million acres of crop area in Pakistan was potentially inundated in August. (OCHA, 4 Sep 2022)Over 2 million houses have been impacted by the devastating floods in Pakistan as of 11 October, with over 1.3 million houses partially destroyed and 800,000 fully destroyed. Some 13,115 km of roads were damaged, and 436 bridges were partially damaged or destroyed. In total, 1,700 people have died, and 12,867 have suffered injuries. The currently available data indicate that around 7.9 million people may be temporarily displaced. About 20.6 million people and 650,000 flood-affected refugees and host communities require humanitarian assistance. The Government of Pakistan is leading the response with the support of UN agencies and humanitarian partners to ensure a coordinated response in food, medicines, health, water, sanitation, and essential supplies and non-food items. (OCHA, 10 Oct 2022)In Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa areas, people are returning to their places of origin or at least close to it to assess their livelihoods' condition. During the last weeks' receding waters were observed, particularly in affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan. In Sindh, water is receding in the districts of Kashmore, Kandhkot, Larkana, Ghotki, Sukkur, Tando Allahyar, Shaheed Benazirabad, Tando Muhammad Khan, Umerkot and Sanghar. [...] In the flood-affected areas of Sindh and Balochistan, outbreaks of water-borne and vector-borne diseases continue to increase, particularly due to the destruction of health facilities and standing water. The Government-led multi-sector rapid needs assessments (RNA) conducted in the worst-affected districts of Sindh indicated that thirty-seven per cent of key informants reported that the nearest health facility is not functional, and the ones who reported a health facility nearby stated the limited capacity of the facility. As of 5 October, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), close to 2,000 health facilities have been either damaged or destroyed. [...] The health situation is also exacerbated by the lack of adequate sanitation facilities. Large parts of Sindh remain flooded, with access continuing to be a challenge in inundated areas. An estimated 5.5 million people no longer have access to safe drinking water due to damages to water infrastructure and sanitation facilities. [...] The current floods have aggravated food insecurity and malnutrition in flood-affected areas. An estimated 14.6 million people require emergency food assistance from December through March 2023, representing an increase of more than 100 per cent of the pre-flood estimate. This includes 4 million people in Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC). (OCHA, 14 Oct 2022)The monsoon rains continue to affect Pakistan by causing floods, landslides, flash floods, and severe weather-related incidents, which have resulted in a humanitarian emergency. Since mid-June, at least 1,730 people have died, of which 792 people died in Sindh Province (south-eastern Pakistan), 336 in Balochistan (south-western Pakistan), and 308 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (north-western Pakistan), according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). Nearly 12,865 individuals have been injured across all Provinces of Pakistan and more than 33 Million people have been affected, of which 14.5 Million in Sindh, and 9.2 million in Balochistan. Widespread damage has been reported to over 2.2 million houses, more than 1.1 million livestock has been lost and more than 13,000 km of roads and 440 bridges have been affected. (ECHO, 25 Oct 2022)Malaria cases are increasing due to the stagnant water, while the incidence of diarrhea is at least five times higher than usual, especially in Sindh and Balochistan, where more than 1 in 9 children under five admitted to health facilities suffered from severe acute malnutrition. More than 3.5 million children's education was interrupted due to the impact of floods. Some sectors noted inadequate funding and delays in supplies as a major gap in responding to the needs of hard-to-reach areas. Roughly only 15-20 per cent of the affected population has received relief assistance from humanitarians. (OCHA, 29 Oct 2022)Public health concerns are high in flood-affected areas of Pakistan, particularly with access to primary healthcare limited by monsoon-induced damage to health facilities. As of 25 October, 59 health facilities are destroyed and 461 are partially damaged in Sindh, where nearly 350,000 people were suspected of having malaria, more than 700,000 people had diarrhea, and over 770,000 people reported a skin-related disease between July and early October. Stagnant water has contributed to malaria outbreaks in 32 districts in Sindh and Balochistan. The practice of open defecation has increased from one-fifth before the floods to over one-third of the affected population, with 6 million people no longer having home sanitation facilities. (OCHA, 1 Nov 2022)As of 8 November, according to World Health Organization (WHO), around 8 million flood-affected people need health assistance. Vector-borne and water-borne diseases remain a major concern in flood-affected areas. Around 1,000 confirmed cholera cases and 64,767 dengue fever cases, with 147 deaths, have been reported. More than 5.1 million women are of reproductive age, including an estimated 410,846 pregnant women. Approximately 136,950 births are expected in the next three months. (OCHA, 11 Nov 2022)According to National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), more than 33 million persons have been affected by the humanitarian emergency caused by the floods, about 1,739 people have died and almost 8 million people have been displaced. Widespread damage has been reported to critical infrastructure, houses and livestock. The findings from a recent ECHO field staff’s visit to flood-affected areas in Sindh and Balochistan show that the situation remains dire with great extensions of land still covered by water. At least 1.85 million people remain still displaced, living in roadside spontaneous camps in poor conditions. A serious concern remains that many of the people returning are moved to places with no infrastructure, no shelter and residing on elevated areas with flood waters around. (OCHA, 28 Nov 2022)Floodwaters continue to recede in many flood-affected areas across Pakistan. However, standing flood waters continue to be reported in Dadu, Kambar, Shahdad Kot, Khairpur, Mirpur Khas, Jamshoro, Sanghar, Umer Kot, Badin, Shaheed Benazir Abad and Naushahro Feroze districts in Sindh and Sohbatpur and Jaffarabad districts in Balochistan. United Nations Satellite Centre (UNOSAT) imagery indicates an estimated 8 million people still potentially exposed to floodwaters or living close to flooded areas. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Sindh, over 240,000 people remain displaced in the province as of 3 December, down from 6.5 million in early September. Nearly 90% of flood-displaced people are reportedly with host communities, while the remaining are in tent cities and relief camps. While receding flood waters have allowed millions of people to go home, there are reports of significant service gaps in areas of return, in addition to extensive impacts to homes, agriculture, and livelihoods. [...] A recent need and gaps analysis by partners in the food security sector indicates a persistent and increasing need for emergency food assistance moving into the first quarter of 2023. A failure to address this need would worsen the already frail food security situation and drive more people into crisis and emergency levels. The food security situation of an estimated additional 1.1 million people is deteriorating and are forecast to fall into IPC 4 (emergency food security phase)
between January-March 2023. Evidence from available data indicates that relief response to date has fallen well short of the need, with over 5.1 million people now experiencing IPC 4 conditions in flood-affected areas. (OCHA, 5 Dec 2022)During the monsoon season, rainfall was equivalent to nearly 2.9 times the national 30-year average, causing widespread flooding and landslides with severe repercussions for human lives, property, and infrastructure. An estimated 20.6 million people, including 9.6 million children, need humanitarian assistance. To date, 94 districts have been declared ‘calamity hit’ by the Government of Pakistan. Many of the hardest-hit districts are amongst the most vulnerable districts in Pakistan, where children already suffer from high malnutrition, poor access to water and sanitation, low school enrolment, and other deprivations. In mountainous and high altitude areas of Pakistan, many also affected by the floods, have received snowfall and temperatures have fallen below 0 Celsius, particularly in the northern and northwestern parts of Pakistan including Khyber Pakhtunkwa (KP), Gilgit Baltistan (GB), Pakistan Administered Kashmir (PAK) and northern Balochistan. (UNICEF, 23 Dec 2022)In some locations of Sindh province and in parts of Balochistan, water has yet to recede and may remain for several months, prolonging the dire humanitarian situation for people in these areas. Flood water remains stagnant in Dadu, Jacobabad, Kambar, Shahdad Kot, Khairpur, Mirpur Khas, Jamshoro, Sanghar, Umer Kot, Badin, Shaheed Benazir Abad and Naushahro Feroze districts in Sindh and Sohbatpur, Jhal Magsi and Jaffarabad districts in Balochistan. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority of Sindh, over 89,000 people remain displaced in the province as of 2 January 2023, down from 6.5 million in early September. The IDPs living in ten districts including Dadu, ShikarPur, Matiari, Mirpur Khas, Jaccobabad, Jamshoro, Tando Allahyar, Thatta, Khairpur and Karachi with the highest number of IDPs in Dadu (41,742) and the lowest in Karachi (356 IDPs). (OCHA, 6 Jan 2023)Food security, livelihood-related assistance and public health are the biggest concerns: based on the latest analysis by UNOSAT, an estimated 4.5 million people remain exposed to or living close to flooded areas. More than 2.5 million people do not have access to safe or potable water. An estimated 1.1 million people are at risk of sliding from acute food and livelihood crisis (IPC3) situations to humanitarian emergency (IPC4) food security situations due to insufficient support. Malaria outbreaks have been reported in at least 12 districts of Sindh and Balochistan. More than 7 million children and women need immediate access to nutrition services. An estimated 3.5 million children, especially girls, are at high risk of permanent school dropout. The Pakistan Floods Response Plan is only 36 per cent funded more than halfway through its 9-month duration. (OCHA, 6 Feb 2023)Camps housing internally displaced persons in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and Punjab provinces have closed, while 29,692 people remain
displaced in Sindh province, with 5,132 people living in temporary tent cities or villages established by the District Disaster Management Authority. High food prices and a heavy reliance on imports continue to threaten Pakistan's food and nutrition security. Meanwhile, the 2022-2023 Rabi season, combined with the unstable availability of wheat flour, has resulted in significant price fluctuations and uncertainty affecting other essential goods’ prices. According to WFP monitoring data, the floods led to a 53 percent increase in new malnutrition cases from July 2022 to January 2023 amongst children enrolled in the 50 pilot facilitation centres of theBenazir Nashonuma Programme, the national social protection scheme aimed at improved health and nutrition. Additional funding is urgently required to treat Moderate and Acute Malnutrition (MAM) to prevent the progression to Severe Acute Malnutrition. (WFP, 28 Feb 2023)Six months after the Government of Pakistan declared a national emergency, approximately 1.8 million people are still living near contaminated and stagnant floodwater pools. Nutrition, food security and public health are the major concerns as many of these people are in temporary shelters, lack basic food items (at risk of sliding into emergency level of hungers) and increased cases of malnutrition. Besides other humanitarian needs in Sindh province, PDMA Sind has declared an urgent need for dewatering activities in the districts of Nausharo Feroze, Khairpur, Sukkur, Jhatta, and Ghotki. To achieve this, five excavators, dewatering pumps, and fuel are required to complete the dewatering process and provide the people in these areas with appropriate livelihood standards. (OCHA, 9 Mar 2023)There is a looming nutrition crisis: the number of children suffering from wasting in Pakistan’s flood-affected areas had greatly increased compared to the pre-flood situation, which was already reaching emergency levels. A rapid survey by UNICEF in 15 flood-affected districts reveals that one-third of children aged 6-23 months suffer from moderate acute malnutrition, and 14% suffer from severe acute malnutrition, a life-threatening form of malnutrition. The rate of severe acute malnutrition in Pakistan is twice that of the South Asian region and four times higher than the global average. The United Nations in Pakistan dedicates US$5.5 million out of the US$6.5 million allocation received from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) towards emergency nutrition and food security interventions in flood impacted areas of Sindh and Balochistan. According to the latest WFP Market Monitor Report, Pakistan's Headline inflation based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is the highest it has been in the past 49 years, having increased by 31.55 per cent in February 2023 compared to February 2022. Since April 2023, heavy rainfall and flashfloods have tragically caused the death of 19 people, injured more than 10, and destroyed properties, bridges, highways, crops, and livestock. (OCHA, 8 May 2023)Despite the passage of nearly a year since the floods, Pakistan is currently facing an imminent nutrition crisis, which has been aggravated by pre-existing high rates of malnutrition in flood-affected regions. Of particular concern is the increasing malnutrition among young children, as undernutrition accounts for nearly half of all deaths in children under five. Shockingly, one in five children under five in Pakistan suffer from wasting, with severe and moderate acute malnutrition rates at 8 percent and 9.7 percent, respectively. The 84 districts affected by the 2022 monsoon flooding display distressing nutrition indicators. These districts have an average severe acute malnutrition rate of 12 percent, impacting over 3.5 million children. Among them, more than 1.45 million children require treatment with Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) due to severe wasting. [...] As of June 5, 2023, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) indicates that approximately 10.5 million people (29 percent of those analyzed) from 43 districts in vulnerable provinces of Pakistan are facing acute food insecurity (IPC Phase 3 or above). Within this population, around 2.1 million individuals (6 percent) are in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), while 8.4 million people (23 percent) are in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis). These areas, including Balochistan (18 districts), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (9 districts), and Sindh (16 districts), were severely affected by the monsoon rains and flooding in late 2022, which greatly impacted food production, consumption, livelihoods, and employment opportunities. (OCHA, 13 Jun 2023)According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the first spell of monsoon rains in Pakistan during the period of 25 June to 10 July has resulted in 86 deaths, 151 injuries, damage to 97 houses, and the loss of 46 livestock. In Punjab province, Lahore City witnessed an exceptional volume of rainfall, setting a record for the highest levels observed in the past three decades. With over 200 mm of rainfall, the city faced significant urban flooding. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued warnings of more rains, wind-thunderstorm, land sliding in hilly areas and high-level flooding in rivers such as Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab, and Jhelum. It is important to note that the monsoon rains are exacerbating the already dire conditions faced by the communities that have been affected by the 2022 floods in Pakistan. Waterborne and vector-borne diseases remain a significant concern in flood-affected districts. 82 cases of Cholera were reported from 12 flood-affected districts.

Of these, 887 extremely vulnerable families were provided with additional assistance such as home deliveries of shelter materials and/or labour support to repair their shelters. Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH): Immediate repairs have been conducted to 207 latrines, 95 bathing cubicles, 2 faecal sludge treatment plants (FSTPs), 17 handpump tube wells, 1 dam (water reservoir) and 2 solid waste management (SWM) sites throughout all the camps. Hygiene promotion activities are ongoing. (ISCG, 30 Jun 2022)According to local authorities, the majority of the displaced families who have been housed in over 1,600 temporary shelters have returned to their homes. However, there are still 19,221 people including 3,229 children and 166 people with disability (PwD) living in 275 shelters in Sylhet and Sunamganj. Hundreds of families are reportedly staying with their relatives and extended family members while some others remain in common buildings. There are people living in remote sub-districts that remain hard to reach due to flooding and poor road infrastructures. Basic services, notably health facilities, are slowly returning to normal. The massive challenges remains in the WASH sector, the Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) estimated that some 106,727 water points and 283,355 sanitation facilities have been immensely damaged, all needs restoration and reconstruction. Meanwhile, the risk of Acute Watery Diarrhoea outbreaks, skin and respiratory diseases continue to be high. As of 13th July, 12,503 cases of waterborne diseases and other ailments have been reported in Sylhet division. (UNICEF, 16 Jul 2022)Barsha is among the 3.5 million children whose lives have been disrupted by floods in north-eastern Bangladesh. Floodwaters in the affected districts have severely damaged almost 45,000 water points and 50,000 sanitation facilities, leaving sheltering families with no access to clean water or latrines. On top of the food shortage, increased risk of drowning, separation from families and violence, children are at increased risk of waterborne diseases.Mothers are worried, as more children come down with diseases due to lack of clean water. As one mother explains: “We haven’t had clean water in days. My children have gotten sick in the shelter drinking dirty water.” (UNICEF, 17 Jul 2022)As of 21 July, there are still 1,590 people, including 636 children, living in 53 shelters in Sylhet district. All families in Sunamganj have already left shelters. The families returning to their damaged homes and lacking access to basic services are in urgent need of multisectoral humanitarian assistance, focused on restoration of services they had before. (UNICEF, 23 Jul 2022)As of 3 August, all families have left the flood shelters in Sylhet and Sunamganj district. They returned home and started caring for the homesteads, which got various damages. Most of the affected families shared their immediate needs in basic household items such as cooking utensils and furniture. They also explained their struggles to access the WASH facilities and lost livelihoods. Thousands of families could not save their crops, seeds, and fodders from the sudden surge of the flood water that stayed for days. Many affected families are now in search of alternative earnings to manage their daily meals. Over the past two weeks, there has been an increase in calls to the Child Helpline 1098, with more than 85 per cent of the calls from flood-affected areas being related to violence against children and women (VACW). As of 29 July, 19,918 cases of waterborne diseases and other ailments have been reported, and 74 people died, including 33 children in Sylhet division. The risk of Acute Watery Diarrhoea outbreaks and skin and respiratory diseases continues to be high. In Sylhet and Sunamganj districts, 349 community clinics out of 505 have been affected by flash flood. Sunamganj, one of the most flood-affected areas, is also one of the districts lagging in education parameters. The high dropout rate in primary education and many out-of-school children pose the biggest challenge. More than 3,000 primary and secondary schools in Sylhet and Sunamganj districts have been affected and remained closed for about a month, resulting in colossal learning loss for over 1.5 million learners. Schools urgently require extensive cleaning and repair work. (UNICEF, 4 Aug 2022)As many as 472,856 people were taken to around 1,605 shelter centres in a combined effort of the Army, Navy, Fire Service, and local authorities, according to the Ministry of Disaster Management and Relief (MoDMR).
