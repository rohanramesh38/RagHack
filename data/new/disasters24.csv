Guyana: Floods ,Jul,2015,Past Disaster,Flood,Guyana,"Heavy rainfall along Guyana’s coastal regions during the period of 15 July and 16 July 2015 has resulted in increased water levels in rivers and canals.

The activation of the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) was authorized. Total losses and the total number of people affected by the flooding are yet to be determined. However, based on the 2012 Preliminary Census Report, with more than 70 per cent of the country’s population living along the coastal areas, a significant number of households have been either directly or indirectly affected. (IFRC, 1 Aug 2015)Continuous assessments have reaffirmed the existing needs, which include relief items such as nets, hygiene kits and storage for drinking water. There is a need to address water and sanitation issues, particularly garbage disposal and consumption of potable water and livelihood assistance, as some of the communities depend entirely on livestock and farming and have had their main source of food and
income severely affected, so their capacity to meet basic needs has been significantly reduced. (IFRC, 5 Oct 2015)",https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2015-000093-guy
Myanmar: Floods and Landslides ,Jul,2015,Past Disaster,Flood1 more,Myanmar,"Heavy rains caused floods and landslides in several parts of Myanmar since June 2015. On 30 July, Cyclone Komen made landfall in Bangladesh, bringing strong winds and additional heavy rains to the country, which resulted in widespread flooding across 12 of the country’s 14 states and regions (Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Mon, Rakhine, Sagaing, Shan, Yangon). On 31 July, the President declared Chin and Rakhine states, and Magway and Sagaing regions as natural disaster zones.According to the National Natural Disaster Management Committee (NNDMC), 125 people were killed and some 1.7 million people were temporarily displaced by floods and landslides. Almost all of the displaced people had returned to their villages of origin by the end of September, leaving only about 10,000 people in evacuation centres (mainly in Sagaing Region and Chin State) awaiting relocation. The Government has said it expects most of these remaining displaced people to return to their villages of origin or to be relocated by the end of October, although a portion of these people may be in temporary accommodation for longer, particularly in the case of people who are going to be permanently relocated to new sites.The NNDMC identified Hakha in Chin State, Kale in Sagaing Region, Pwintbyu in Magway Region, and Minbya and Mrauk-U in Rakhine as the five most affected townships where a total of 229,600 people were affected by the floods. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, over 1.1 million acres of farmlands have been inundated, with more than 872,000 acres destroyed, as of 4 October. So far, 495,000 acres have since been re-cultivated. Damage to crops and arable land will disrupt the planting season and pose a risk to long-term food security.While the water has receded in most areas, many roads and bridges were destroyed in the worst affected states and regions. The roads in Chin State were particularly badly affected and continue to pose a major logistical challenge for assessments and assistance delivery.Multi-sectoral Initial Rapid Assessments (MIRA) were conducted in 317 locations of 34 townships in Ayeyarwady, Bago, Chin, Magway, Rakhine and Sagaing, covering close to 200,000 people. Other needs assessments were also carried out in areas not covered by the MIRA assessments in Chin and Rakhine states. According to the Rakhine State Government (RSG), Buthidaung, Kyauktaw, Minbya, Maungdaw and Mrauk-U townships were the most severely affected areas in Rakhine State. In many parts of Rahine State, floods and salt water severely damaged the paddy fields. A major concern remains water contamination, as most villages use water ponds for drinking water and many ponds were flooded and contaminated.(OCHA, 4 Nov 2015)Six months on from the devastating floods that struck Myanmar, around 400,000 people have received emergency assistance and support in their recovery from the Myanmar Red Cross Society and its partners in the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. At their peak the floods affected over 9 million people across 12 of Myanmar’s 14 states and regions. The floods temporarily displaced over 1.7 million people and destroyed 15,000 homes as well as more than 840,000 acres of agricultural crops.Between July 2015 and January 2016, over 1,400 Red Cross volunteers and staff from the Myanmar Red Cross Society and Red Cross partners assisted flood affected people across the country. The first phase included evacuations, providing emergency relief such as purified water, food, household items, and shelter materials. Since then, efforts have been focused on supporting the longer term recovery of flood affected communities across the five worst hit regions of Chin, Rakhine, Sagaing, Magway and Ayerwady with livelihood activities, cleaning of contaminated ponds and wells and infrastructure rehabilitation.

In Lower and Middle Shabelle regions, the floods were caused by high water levels in the upper stream of Shabelle river and led to the displacement of 13,500 people, while flash floods due to heavy rains in Gaalkacyo in Mudug region displaced 2,700 people. The floods have also destroyed about 6,800 hectares of farmland. (OCHA, 25 May 2015)According to the FAO’s Somalia Water and Land Information Management, (SWALIM), the Gu main rainy season (April-June) began in late March and ended in early May in many parts of the north and southern and central regions of Somalia. Most parts of the country received normal to above normal rainfall, which led to improved water availability and pasture growth, especially for pastoral and agro-pastoral dependent households. However, some places recorded significantly below normal rains. (OCHA, 16 Jul 2015)",https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2015-000040-som
