(ECHO, 16 Oct 2023)More than 26,000 people have been displaced so far by floods in south-eastern Ghana, according to national authorities. High water levels in the Akosombo reservoir led the Volta River Authority to start a controlled spillage process of the Akosombo and Kpong hydroelectric dams on 15 September 2023, which is still ongoing. The flooding has created a humanitarian challenge downstream in several communities in parts of the Volta, Eastern and Greater Accra regions. (OCHA, 18 Oct 2023)The Volta Region in Ghana has experienced heavy rains and high inflows of water to the Akosombo and Kpong dam reservoir, leading to severe flooding that has displaced 30,000 people in 8 districts. Infrastructure, crops, and shelters have been damaged, and access to essential services has been disrupted. (IOM, 27 November 2023)[...] Initial inter-agency assessment led by NADMO on the consecutive floods in Volta region revealed on 26 October, 35,857 people in total are already affected in the region. Following the situation, the local authorities requested the assistance of Red Cross on 30 October. The WFP observatory latest report of 24 October 2023 had estimated that 465,180 people are leaving in the flooded locations 45,326 hectares of flooded cropland areas. [...] Women, Children and the elderly less likely to cope in situation of stress due to displacements and living in crowded areas in the evacuation centers are the most vulnerable.

Tropical Storm Daniel ,Sep,2023,Past Disaster,Flood2 more,Libya1 more,"Storm Daniel developed in Greece and was named by the Hellenic National Meteorological Service. [It] caused record-breaking rainfall in Greece on 5-6 September, with a reported 750 mm falling in 24 hours at a station in the village of Zagora. This is the equivalent of about 18 months of rainfall. In Thessaly, central Greece, many stations received 400 to 600 mm of rainfall in 24 hours. Thessaly is Greece’s agricultural heartland, and so the economic impacts are expected to be serious. (WMO, 12 Sep 2023)On 10 September, Storm Daniel made landfall in Libya causing severe weather conditions, including strong winds and sudden heavy rainfall affecting several northeastern areas of Libya (Benghazi, Tobruk, Toukra, Talmeitha, Almarj, Taknes (Al Jabal Al Akhdar), Al Owailia, Bayada, Albayda, Shahhat, Sousa and Derna). The storm reportedly led to significant infrastructure damage, including road network, disrupted the telecommunications network, and caused the displacement of at least 410 families (or around 2,050 individuals) and 35 migrants.

Slovenia: Floods ,Aug,2023,Past Disaster,Flash Flood2 more,Slovenia,"On 3-4 August, severe weather with heavy rain affected western, northern, eastern and central parts of the country, causing severe flooding and landslides. Some areas were inaccessible and necessary evacuations of residents took place. Slovenian Environment Agency (ARSO) has issued a red weather alert and the national emergency response plan for floods has been activated. The national authorities confirmed one person died. On 5 August, severe weather conditions continued to affect the country. Heaviest precipitation was reported mainly in the foothills of the Julian Alps and along the line of the Zidanško–Idrija region, through Gorenjska towards Koroška and the Upper Savinjska region. The Savinja Valley, Gorenjska and Koroška regions were severely affected, as a bridge on the main transport road was swept away and many state roads remain closed due to the flooding. During the day and overnight the precipitation moved to the south-east of Slovenia towards Kočevje, Kolpa and Bela Krajina region, where highest risk levels were declared. On 6 August severe weather conditions persisted in Slovenia with rivers still overflowing across the country. The Sava River flooded heavily. Drava River was stabilised in the upper reaches and was moderated in the lower reaches. Mura river in Gornja Radgona was stabilised. It was reported that embankment on Mura river near settlement Krapje Verzej was breached. The Krka river overflowed in some areas. Problematic areas concerned the Sava and Krka rivers confluence around Krška Vas. The water level of Drava river slowly receded. Its flow, including from the Austrian side, was under control. A similar pattern was also observed for Mura river. On 7 August, the situation in Slovenia has slightly improved, however the situation remained critical since some rivers were still overflowing across the country. The heavy rainfall caused widespread damage leading to the collapse of at least seven main and regional bridges and mainly impacted roads and the energy infrastructure. Many more local bridges were damaged. On 8 August access to remote areas and areas affected by landslides still remained difficult. Approximately two-thirds of Slovenia's territory is currently grappling with the aftermath of flash floods, torrential rain, and hailstorm, with 181 municipalities affected out of the total of 212.

The loss of assets, homes and businesses, livestock, crops and infrastructure will affect job security and livelihoods in the mid-to long term. Because of the continuous threat of landslides, it is expected that more households will become in need of long-term shelter and basic needs support during the upcoming months.
