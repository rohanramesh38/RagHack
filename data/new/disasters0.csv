Cameroon: Floods ,Aug,2024,Ongoing,Flood,Cameroon,"Severe flooding in Cameroon's Far North region has affected over 158,620 people, including 38,069 women of reproductive age and 4,133 pregnant women. The hardest-hit areas are Mayo-Tsanaga, Mayo-Danay, and Logone-and-Chari divisions, with significant damage to infrastructure, farmland, and disruption of essential services. UNFPA has deployed midwives and social workers to affected areas and is coordinating with partners to track displacement and assess needs. UNFPA-supported health facilities continue to operate in some areas, providing essential SRH and GBV services. The response efforts are focusing on food security, shelter, non-food items, health (including SRH), and water, hygiene, and sanitation. Ongoing heavy rains and the risk of disease outbreaks, including cholera, pose additional challenges to the humanitarian response. UNFPA is urgently appealing for USD 1,174,045 to scale up SRH and GBV interventions in flood-affected areas, targeting 129,149 people.

Nigeria: Floods ,Aug,2024,Ongoing,Flood,Nigeria,"In the early hours of August 20, 2024, the Kiri Dam in Tudun Tsira, Shelleng LGA, Adamawa State, breached its banks, resulting in severe flooding across the communities of Kwakwambe, Lure, Nbalang, Imburu, and Bare in the Numan Local Government Area. The deluge caused extensive damage, overwhelming local capacities and necessitating immediate humanitarian intervention. Just one day later, the communities of Duhu, Mayowandu, Kirchinga, Maiwandu, Jahili, Kokohu, Lumadu, Zhau, Pallam, Kwambula, Shuware, and Shuwa in Madagali Local Government Area were struck by another catastrophic flood, triggered by the upstream flow of waters from the Cameroonian highlands. This secondary flooding event exacerbated the already dire situation, compounding the devastation and further straining local resources. According to the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), the floodwaters rose with alarming speed, catching residents off guard and resulting in the widespread destruction of homes, infrastructure, and livelihoods. The disaster has affected 12,583 individuals, displaced 2,079 households, and caused the destruction of 298 buildings, 203 farmlands, and 509 livestock. The immediate humanitarian needs include shelter, food, non-food items, medical assistance, and access to clean water.

South Sudan: Floods ,Jul,2024,Ongoing,Flood,South Sudan,"Humanitarian partners expect floods in the second half of 2024, with a peak from September to December. This is compatible with the 4-month lead time expected between the Eastern Nile Lakes peak. However, humanitarian needs will likely arise before that date as the flooding progressively increases, thus SRCS expects to start response operations in the weeks before September. Following the alerts from IGAD Climate Prediction and Applications Centre of the high probability of wetter-than-usual conditions in South Sudan for the current rainy season, together with the highest ever recorded in the history of Lake Victoria and the incoming water pressure over the Jinja Dam in Uganda, the South Sudan Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation together with the Ministry of Humanitarian Assistance are expecting unprecedented floods over large areas of the country. Similar scenarios are also projected by major UN partners in the country, as well as independent experts, with the seasonal flood extent minimum reached in May, which was similar to the minima of recent seasons and the above-average rainfall in South Sudan will likely feed itself into the flood extent and reduce evaporation losses. (IFRC, 1 Aug 2024)Continuous heavy rains since May, combined with controlled water releases from Lake Victoria, have significantly raised Nile River levels, affecting up to 472,000 people across 26 of South Sudan's 78 counties and Abyei Administrative Area.

Five people died, including two minors while swimming in the Gash River, while five people were injured in Kassala State.

Nepal: Floods and Landslides ,Jun,2024,Past Disaster,Flood,Nepal,"Flood is the most severe of the hazards observed in Nepal in terms of physical and socioeconomic losses and destruction. Koshi, Karnali, and Narayani are the major river systems in Nepal, and floods from these large perennial river systems generally impact several districts in the Southern Terai plains. Moreover, rivers such as West Rapti, and Babai Rivers, which originate in the Mahabharat range, do more damage in the Terai floodplains because they frequently generate flash floods during the monsoon. Moreover, the Terai's vulnerable topography, combined with its dependency on agriculture, exacerbates the severity of flood hazards compared to other regions. (IFRC, 12 Jun 2024)The targeted flood-prone areas are the Terai districts along the flood plains of Karnali, Babai and West Rapti rivers, namely Banke, Bardiya and Kailali, frequently affected due to flooding in the monsoon period. People living along these rivers especially low-lying areas, informal settlements, fragile houses, and those who have low-income status and a number of dependent family members to care for, are highly vulnerable to flooding; especially during the monsoon (June to September).
