Somalia: Flash Floods ,Apr,2020,Past Disaster,Flash Flood1 more,Somalia,"The 2020 Gu’ rains (April-June) have intensified across Somalia, triggering flash flooding in South West State, Jubaland, Bandir, Puntland and Somaliland from 20-23 April. As water levels rise in rivers, there are reports of riverine flooding in Jubaland. FAO’s Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM) reported heavy rains in Somaliland where on 26 April, Lughaye and surrounding areas received unusually heavy rains of 102mm. On 23 April, heavy rains were also received within the Juba river basin. SWALIM forecasts increased rainfall activity in most areas in Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands in the coming week, which is likely to keep the water levels high in the Shabelle and Juba rivers. The flooding has started barely four months after heavy Deyr (October-December) rains inundated parts of Somalia, affecting over half a million people; and as the country works to contain the COVID-19 virus, which is exponentially rising and has already infected several hundreds of people. The country is also working to contain a desert locust infestation.OCHA, 24 Apr 2020)Since 20 April, heavy rain has been affecting most of Somalia States and territories (particularly South West, Jubaland, Banadir, Puntland, and Somaliland) as well as the neighbouring central and south Ethiopia since 24 April, causing rivers to overflow and triggering floods that have resulted in casualties and damage. The worst affected area is the Juba river basin and the Shabelle river basin. In Somalia, as of 29 April, media report 10 fatalities, a number of missing people, around 20 injured people, hundreds more displaced, as well as damage to infrastructure in Qardho Town (Bari Region, west Puntland). (ECHO, 29 Apr 2020)The number of people affected by flooding in Somalia has risen to 546,103, of whom 216,895 people have been displaced from their homes and 16 others killed since the Gu’ rains started in early April. At least 27 districts are inundated; the worst being Belet Weyne in Hiran region where riverine flooding has displaced more than 115,000 people, according to the district flood taskforce. This includes about 91,000 people who have been displaced from the four sections of the town and 23,220 people from 23 riverine villages. The flooding resulted from a sharp rise in the level of the Shabelle river following heavy rains in Somalia and the Ethiopian highlands. According to the taskforce, more people were fleeing their homes as river levels rise. As of 10 May, the river levels reached 7.93 meters which is 0.37 meter below the bank full level of 8.30 meters. (OCHA, 11 May 2020)Ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 918,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts, as of 16 May. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to crowding in areas where displaced people are seeking temporary shelter. (OCHA, 16 May 2020)As of 19 May, ongoing flash and riverine flooding in Somalia has affected about 919,000 people, of whom 412,000 have been displaced and 24 killed, in 29 districts. Belet Weyne in Hiraan region is the most affected district after the Shabelle river burst its banks on 12 May, inundating 85 per cent of Belet Weyne town and 25 riverine villages. According to the district flood taskforce, about 240,000 people were displaced from the town and neighbouring villages between 12 and 18 May. In Jowhar district, Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected more than 98,000 people in 37 locations, bringing the total affected in Hirshabelle to 338,000 people. According to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management in Hirshabelle State, nearly 40 per cent of those affected in Jowhar have been displaced from their homes. The risk of disease outbreaks is high due to overcrowding in areas where the displaced people are seeking temporary. (OCHA, 5 Jun 2020)Flash and riverine floods have since late June affected an estimated 191,800 people in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland states as well as Banadir region. Among those affected, about 124,200 people have been displaced from their homes. Another 5,000 peope are at risk of further displacement in Jowhar, Middle Shabelle. Since May, an estimated 149,000 hectares of farmland have been damaged by floods in 100 villages in Jowhar, Mahaday and Balcad districts, Middle Shabelle region. (OCHA, 26 Jul 2020)The latest floods point to a worrying pattern where extreme weather conditions are increasing in frequency and intensity. Prior to June 2020, flash floods and riverine flooding caused by seasonal rains displaced more than 450,000 in the country. With floods in 2018 and 2019 displacing 281,000 and 416,000 persons respectively, the flood-based displacement figures demonstrate a rising year-to-year trend. Somalia’s re-occurring climate related emergencies result in devastating impact on communities who heavily rely on farming and livestock for their livelihood. (UNHCR, 7 Aug 2020)Riverine flooding continues to displace people and inundate farmland in rural areas mainly along the Shabelle river valley. The floods, which are attributed to the Hagaa seasonal rains, have affected nearly 500,000 people since late June in Hirshabelle, South West and Jubaland States, as well as Banadir region.

At least 40,000 people were rendered homeless after the Nzoia river burst its banks on the weekend of 2 May. Since the beginning of the country’s ‘long rains’ season in early March, more than 233,000 people have been affected, including over 116,000 displaced, according to the Kenya Red Cross Society. Flooding has been reported in more than three quarters of Kenya’s counties (36 out of 47), with landslides reported in the Rift Valley and the central and coastal regions, according to the Government’s National Disaster Operations Centre. The Kenya Meteorological Department forecasts aboveaverage rainfall throughout May in parts of the Rift Valley, and in the central, western and coastal regions of Kenya, which could result in further flooding. The heavy rains have increased the risk of health emergencies and provided conditions conducive to the further breeding of desert locusts in Kenya.

On 19 April, according to local authorities, 27,972 people were displaced due to the Ruzizi river overflowing into six districts of Gatumba in Mutimbuzi Commune (Bujumbura Rural province). 6,010 houses were flooded, severely damaged or destroyed. Strong winds, torrential rains, and landslides have affected a total of 813 people in Rumonge province (715) and Bubanza province (98), the majority of whom are now displaced. The damage toll is still rising as flooded houses continue to collapse. (OCHA, 22 Apr 2020)In affected provinces, up to 160 homes were destroyed and 70 partially damaged, alongside 7,600 inundated in Mutimbuzi commune. Heavy and above-average rainfall is anticipated to continue until mid-May, potentially increasing displacement and testing coping capacity. Capacity to provide aid may be restricted throughout the upcoming rains, particularly as elections in May may divert government attention and resources. If flood water is untreated and people cannot access safe water, cholera and malaria may further spread. (ACAPS, 1 May 2020)Over 2,100 victims of severe flooding and mudslides in Burundi are receiving help from IOM, the International Organization for Migration (IOM). Weeks of torrential rain have hit Burundi affecting 45,000 people and sweeping away thousands of homes and businesses, leaving 18,000 people newly displaced. Three large displacement sites for victims have emerged around Burundi’s capital, Bujumbura, where thousands are living in temporary or makeshift accommodations. There are concerns the new displacement sites could increase their risk of contracting COVID-19, due to their overcrowded and unsanitary conditions. IOM under the coordination of OCHA, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and other UN agencies here are moving to reduce risk of potential exposure to COVID-19 during distributions of shelter, hygiene kits, and other types of emergency support. (IOM, 29 May 2020)Flooding has destroyed thousands of hectares of crops that were ready for harvest (mainly pulses and cereals), depriving the locals of essential food stocks for the coming year. With over 80 per cent of the population reliant on subsistence farming, already vulnerable communities will likely suffer a difficult lean season due to insufficient harvests, as well as increased market prices.

Media report, as of 2 April, at least 11 fatalities, 15 injured people, around 288 houses destroyed and 400 more damaged (including 30 mosques), and several power outages across the aforementioned Provinces.(ECHO, 2 Apr 2020)Since 28 March, flash floods following heavy rain affected 18 provinces in north-central and west regions of Afghanistan. Preliminary information suggests that floods have killed 11 people, while 15 people are injured. Most affected provinces are Farah, Badghis, Faryab, Baghlan, Takhar and Parwan. Needs assessments are coordinated by the local authorities and humanitarian agencies. The flash floods displaced families. At least 288 houses were completely destroyed, and 400 houses were partially damaged. Furthermore 500 hectares of agricultural crops were washed away.(ECHO, 3 Apr 2020)OCHA’s natural disaster tracking dashboardshows that more than 15,300 people have been affected by floods (13,900), landslides (616) and avalanches (819) since the start of the year. During flood-related displacement, host communities tend to extend their limited resources to families in need. Most displaced families are normally hosted by relatives or in neighbouring communities while they wait for the rain to subside prior to starting repair of their shelters. This coping mechanism creates favourable conditions for higher transmission of COVID-19 and in some cases may give rise to protection concerns for displaced people and their hosts. This is particularly concerning for the country’s west and south bordering Iran and Pakistan where flooding is already taking place. IOM and other ES-NFI partners have so far conducted 127 joint assessments in areas affected by floods. Assessment findings showed that more than 1,400 homes have been either damaged or destroyed.
