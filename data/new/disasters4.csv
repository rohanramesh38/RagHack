This included high-level engagement with Union ministers by the RC/HC ai and UN agencies in Sittwe. Despite the humanitarian access restrictions, aid organizations have been delivering vital assistance to cyclone-affected communities where they have authorizations and supplies. More than 144,000 affected people have received shelter and other essential relief items in Rakhine and other areas since the cyclone. However, only a fraction of damaged and destroyed shelters have reportedly been repaired, leaving thousands of people without a proper roof over their heads during the monsoon season and exposing them to overcrowding and lack of privacy in the few shelters that remain functional.

[...] Travel authorization issues pose challenges to the operations of Cluster partners, severely delaying the delivery of response activities. In Kyauktaw township, the need for partners to actively provide education services during emergencies hampers education delivery in critical situations. Cyclone-affected areas across the country are struggling with debris that has yet to be cleared, slowing down the repair and reopening of schools. The persistent aerial attacks on schools have exacerbated the humanitarian situation for learners. These attacks not only endanger the lives and well-being of students but also threatens the stability of the education system.
