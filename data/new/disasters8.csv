Unofficial estimates place the economic losses at around USD 200 million. Dozens of roads and highways remain closed. There have been unscheduled water cuts and disruptions to the electricity supply. Search and rescue have been hampered by a lack of assets (boats and other vessels) to navigate through the waterways formed around high-density residential areas near low-lying flood basins, exacerbated by coordination issues between authorities. The situation is worsened in low-cost housing areas, where residents of single-storey linked houses do not have the option of moving themselves and their assets to the upper floors. There have been medical evacuations as the elderly and people with chronic diseases suffered from lack of food, running water, disrupted electricity supply and shortage of medication.

[...] The latest government figures indicate 130,128 families or 477,614 people affected in 1,417 barangays in Regions V, VI, VII, VIII, X, XI, Caraga and MIMAROPA [...]. Due to power disruptions and intermittent signals, it has been challenging to obtain further details from the ground. Hence, these reported numbers are expected to increase significantly. Pre-emptively 332,855 people were evacuated, and 1,603 evacuation centres hosted 77,494 families (289,049 individuals).

Children are at risk of falling behind due to school closures (6,200 classrooms are damaged nationwide) and increasing food insecurity resulting in malnutrition. (OCHA, 13 Jan 2022)One month on, families are still reeling from the storm’s effects and struggling to pick up the pieces of their lives. Meanwhile, a country-wide COVID-19 surge and heavy rains linked to La Niña are severely hampering the response in the Caraga region in north-eastern Mindanao, and the Leyte and Southern Leyte provinces of the Visayas islands. While many of the displaced people have returned home, 160,000 people remain in evacuation centres. Hospitals are at limited capacity and many health facilities have been damaged, which include COVID and birthing facilities. There are over four million women and girls of reproductive age in the affected areas with 162,000 believed to be pregnant. Many women and girls have been left without access to reproductive health support. This will be further worsened by the current COVID-19 surge.

Of these, 423,492 are completely destroyed with the most affected provinces are Cebu, Bohol (region VII) and Surigao del Norte (region XIII) accounting for 61% of destroyed homes. In Palawan, government reports have shown 77,000 houses are damaged or destroyed which housed over 385,000 individuals. However, the damage from the Typhoon goes well beyond the direct impact to housing and sanitation facilitates, to disruptions to livelihoods, infrastructure and massively increased protection risks in the most vulnerable communities. Over 220 health facilities have been damaged, and access to others is disrupted, further complicated by the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak over the past month. In terms of impact to the agriculture sector, the damage and losses report from the Department of Agriculture (DA) as of 18 January 2022 showed that the total value of damages and losses is at over US$261 million. Partners issued a preliminary assessment on labor and employment indicating that almost 2.2 million workers are estimated to have been directly impacted. Across all affected regions, understanding and assessment of complex protection concerns related to disability, GBV, sexual and reproductive health and other vulnerabilities, especially among adolescents, girls and women, and other vulnerabilities remain under-assessed.

Due to a surge in COVID-19 cases, the pandemic continues to threaten public health and safety and is also creating multiple operational challenges for the humanitarian response. (OCHA, 27 Jan 2022)While electricity services are being restored, many locations remain without power and 76 municipalities still have limited access to communications for voice and data even six weeks later. At least 220 health facilities have been damaged, and many are running at limited capacity with lack of fuel, medicines and supplies, even as a new wave of Covid-19 is affecting many areas. The typhoon has reversed the school reopening process, increasing the levels of learning loss already caused by school closures and the risk of permanent drop-outs, neglecting children’s right to education. Over 4,000 classrooms have been destroyed and 2 million children’s learning has been disrupted, compounding the impact from Covid-19 measures. (OCHA, 2 Feb 2022)To date, UNICEF reached over 46,000 individuals with emergency WASH supplies.

Seven weeks on, $28.6 million worth of assistance has been provided to the affected families by the Government. Camp management and shelter, WASH, protection and GBV, agriculture and health remain the top priority. On 2nd February 2022, the Humanitarian Country Team launched the revised Humanitarian Needs and Priorities plan for six months to supplement the ongoing relief efforts led by the Government. The plan seeks $169 million, up from $107 million. (OCHA, 11 Feb 2022)In typhoon-affected areas of Bohol and Cebu (Region VII), needs have evolved from life-saving assistance to early recovery, according to a scoping mission by OCHA that met with the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD)'s Regional Office and Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (PDRRMO) between the 13 to 16 February. The scoping mission was deployed to Region VII to identify the humanitarian needs and gaps in the aftermath of Typhoon Rai (Odette), map the presence of humanitarian agencies and assess the coordination capacity of the government. Although there is limited humanitarian presence, Region VII has a relatively higher response capacity and has rolled out a voucher assistance program for shelter.

On 15 March 2022, the Caraga Regional Disaster Response Committee issued deactivation of regional coordination mechanism for Typhoon Rai response operations. The guidance cites the closure of evacuation centers; decreasing the number of augmentation requests from the local government, particularly of food packs; and deactivation of regional response clusters. The government member agencies, cluster leads and concerned agencies continue to monitor and respond to the affected families as necessary, with the HCT partners augmenting response of local government units.
