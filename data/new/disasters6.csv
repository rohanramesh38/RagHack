Lisa was moving to the West at 12 mph with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and a minimum central pressure of 1003 mb. The system is forecasted to continue on a general west to west-north-westward track for the next few days with landfall possible on Belize late on Wednesday 2 November night or early Thursday 3 November in the morning. Lisa is expected to strengthen with the potential to make landfall as a category 1 hurricane on Belize. At 12:00 pm on 31 October 2022 the National Hydrological Service released Flood Bulletin No. 1 for Tropical Storm Lisa indicating areas expected to increase to flood stages across the entire country affecting main rivers.

At the time of the submission of the Initial Situation Assessment (ISA), there were no reported fatalities associated with the storm’s passage. The storm has resulted, however, in the temporary displacement of a large number of persons, with an estimated 5K+ seeking refuge in state managed shelters across the country of Belize. The ISA reports damages primarily to the housing sector which is reflective of the poor housing stock associated with the areas of affectation. An estimated 500 houses have been reported as being completely destroyed, with an additional 5,000 homes suffering from light, medium and heavy damages. The NEMO reports initial damage estimates to the housing sector as being approximately USD$10M with most of this damage recorded within the Belize District.

Cameroon: Floods ,Aug,2022,Past Disaster,Flood,Cameroon,"Since August 2022, the Far North region has been experiencing flooding in several localities in the MayoDanay, Logone et Chari and Mayo-Tsanaga divisions. These floods are the result of heavy rainfall, the overflowing of rivers and the breaching of dikes. As of 21 September 2022, over 37,000 people were affected by floods with two people killed and more than 95 people injured. More than 9,000 houses were destroyed, about a dozen health facilities and 88 schools were flooded with over 26,615 children deprived of education. More than 2,400 hectares of fields were destroyed, 3,019 livestock were lost, 190 water points and 535 latrines were submerged. Communities were forced to move to safer areas, often in very precarious conditions with difficult access to drinking water, lack of latrines, food, shelters, etc. Access to hard-to-reach areas has been severely hampered by the floods, impacting the timely delivery of nutrition, food, health and protection services. Continued rainfall and rising water levels could cause the remaining dikes along the Logone river and Lake Maga to break, resulting in flooding in several localities. Despite the spontaneous response of local authorities and of the Cameroonian Red Cross, needs remain high, and the funds limited. Under the coordination of OCHA, humanitarian actors in the region are further helping to assess the situation and organizing the support to the ongoing response made by local authorities. (OCHA, 11 Oct 2022)More than 150,000 people have been affected by flooding resulting from heavy rainfall and river overflow in the Far North region since August. Floods have destroyed over 18,000 homes and at least 27,400 hectares of fields. Water points and latrines were damaged and more than 5,800 cattle lost. School activities were disrupted as more than 126 schools were flooded, affecting more than 38,000 students. Mayo-Danay, Logone et Chari, and Mayo-Tsanaga are the most affected departments. Access to the affected areas is reduced due to flooded roads while the presence of hippos in the waterways discourages travel by boat. Thousands of people have been displaced to areas not affected by the floods with limited access to drinking water, latrines, and food. The majority of displaced people are with host families or in makeshift shelters in the open air. Most urgent needs include shelter, WASH, food, NFIs and healthcare.
