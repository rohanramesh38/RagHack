With the recession of waters, people resumed their livelihood activities, in particular farming. Compared to the events in 2011, floods in 2013 appear to have been less extensive in scale, although in some provinces the impact – including number of evacuated families, damaged crops, damaged infrastructure - was more significant due to a combination of factors such as: unexpected gravity of the floods, both in extent and intensity, longer time for waters to recede, repeated floods and flash floods, limited preparedness undertaken in advance, limited early warning.
