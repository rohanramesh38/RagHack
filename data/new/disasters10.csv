Tajikistan: Floods and Mudslides ,May,2021,Past Disaster,Flood2 more,Tajikistan,"The torrential rains of 7 – 12 May 2021 triggered floods, landslides and mudflows in many of the country’s districts. The largest number of losses and destructions are faced by districts and cities of Khatlon province. Disasters affected following cities and districts: Kulob city and districts of Vakhsh, Jomi, Vose, Shamsiddini Shohin, Yovon, Dusti, Muminobod, Qushoniyon, Dangara and Khuroson. Assessment of the damage is on-going by the authorities. Up to date, assessment reports confirm the destruction of at least 128 houses and significant damage to around 400 houses. Damages caused by disasters to private and social infrastructure have disrupted the livelihoods of over 14,500 people, according to initial estimations. (OCHA/UNCT Tajikistan, 19 May 2021)The Committee of Emergency Situations and Civil Defence under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan (CoES) reported the death of nine people caused by the disaster. Preliminary estimates indicate that households were displaced and 907 houses were damaged to different extents. Very modest estimations indicate that the damages to private and social infrastructure caused disruptions to the livelihoods of more than 25,010 people. The floods and subsequent landslides and mudflows affected districts to various extents, causing different levels of damage. Kulob town appeared to be the worst affected area, with the death of 3 people and an estimated 15 streets covered by mud. Up to date, the Government Assessment Teams identified 586 households with different levels of damage. As of 19 May , updated estimates report over 850 households as affected and in need of assistance. Most of the affected population have lost their assets and food stocks, as well as access to clean drinking water, as water supply system has been damaged by the mudflow. Sanitation conditions are severely worsened, as latrines are damaged and flooded. (IFRC, 24 May 2021)",https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2021-000055-tjk
Somalia: Floods ,May,2021,Past Disaster,Flash Flood1 more,Somalia,"Heavy Gu season rains have hit various parts of the country over the last week, triggering flash floods and inundating vast swathes of land, but the short-term forecast suggests the heavy rainfall will begin to subside from mid-May onward. Reports indicate that at least 25 people have been killed due to the heavy rains including nine children who died after their house flooded in Banadir on 7 May, and four people killed by lightening in Puntland on 5 May. In Middle Shabelle region, riverine flooding has affected an estimated 25,000 people in 15 villages in Jowhar, displacing people in eight villages and inundating farms. FAO/SWALIM has warned of the imminent danger of potentially unprecedented flooding expected along the Shabelle river in the coming days and the concern for safety and wellbeing of the people in Belet Weyne and along the river. Reports from Jubaland indicate that the Juba river broke its bank in Doolow, reaching 4.70 metres, which is 0.20 metres above the moderate flooding level, flooding three villages.(OCHA, 9 May 2021)The recent torrential rains across Somalia affected an estimated 166,000 people. While the rains have reduced in some areas, humanitarian partners are alarmed that Somalia has been hit by a double climate disaster, with drought declared on 25 April and heavy rains last week causing riverine and flash flooding. The seven-day forecast ending 20 May indicates a dry spell is likely across Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands, which may lead to a reduction of the risk of flooding along the Shabelle and Juba rivers. Humanitarian partners are particularly concerned about areas where the risk of flooding remans, particularly in Belet Weyne in Hiiran region and Doolow in Jubaland where there remains a high-risk level of flooding as the water from Ethiopia highlands stream in. The flood wave from Belet Weyne will be transmitted to the middle and lower reaches towards the end of the week and therefore there is a moderate risk of flooding in these areas during this week. The situation could be further exacerbated by weak river embankments and open riverbanks, which is already causing floods in Jowhar.(OCHA, 17 May 2021)The ongoing Gu’ rains have significantly reduced with many parts of Somalia receiving below average cumulative amounts over the last week. The latest forecast indicates that the continuation of these rains from late May through June is uncertain. However, the rains received triggered flash floods in some areas and will affect food security and livelihoods, with the 2021 Gu’ season cereal production expected to be 20-40% below average. Humanitarian partners estimate that at least 166,000 people have been affected by flooding since the beginning of the Gu’ season.(OCHA, 26 May 2021)",https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2021-000051-som

Water, sanitation and hygiene partners will support the restoration of damaged water sources in affected areas. (OCHA, 2 Jun 2021)Heavy rainfall in north-eastern Afghanistan (especially Nuristan Province) over the last 48 hours, has caused flash floods. Media report at least 60 fatalities, a number of people still missing, 200 destroyed houses, and damage to roads across the Miardish Village (Kamdesh District, eastern Nuristan Province, bordering with Pakistan). Over the next 24 hours, moderate rainfall is forecast over north-eastern Afghanistan, including Nuristan Province. (ECHO, 30 Jul 2021)In late night of 28 July 2021, massive flash floods, triggered by heavy rain, occurred in Mirdesh village in Kamdesh district in Nuristan province – eastern part of Afghanistan. As per the initial field reports, around 150 lives are lost with 113 dead bodies found as of 31 July 2021 – others were still missing. Around 300 residential houses are impacted with 200 houses fully damaged. One public bridge and four small bridges are also damaged. The water also swept away cattle, destroyed agricultural lands and also demolished a large part of a road in Kamdesh district. (IFRC, 5 Aug 2021)In response to severe flooding that took place on 29 July in Maherdish Village in Kamdesh District, Nuristan Province, UN assistance was dispatched and distributed to 1,631 people. The aid included relief items, shelter supplies, tarpaulins, a two month supply of emergency food, and nutritional supplies for women and children.

Also, 105 people reportedly were affected by flash floods in Behsud District in Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province. Interagency assessment teams were deployed to affected area to assess humanitarian needs. (OCHA, 5 Sep 2021)Since the massive flash floods in Nuristan Province that occurred in the late night of 28 July, the Afghan Red Crescent Society (ARCS) had conducted a damage and needs assessment in Kamdesh district – a remote area that was then not under government control. Based on updated figures tabulated by 1 August, in addition to the loss of more than 260 lives, nearly 30 business premises, 3 mosques, and 7 bridges were destroyed, as well as water and electricity infrastructure and over 360 hectares of agricultural land and 3,200 fruit trees. The floods risks of Nuristan remain - recently, flash flood warnings for Nuristan were also issued by the Civil Aviation Authority Meteorological Department. Coupled with the remoteness of the village and devastation from the flash floods of 28 July, the areas continue to require immediate humanitarian assistance for disaster relief and early recovery. (IFRC, 5 Nov 2021)Even though it has been more than five months since the devastating floods in early May, the situation in Afghanistan has complicated the early recovery processes of the affected communities, and environmental threats remain due to reduced coping mechanisms. With winter already having started, humanitarian assistance is assessed to be still needed for floods-affected households to ensure sustenance through winter and to enhance their resilience for future flash floods.
